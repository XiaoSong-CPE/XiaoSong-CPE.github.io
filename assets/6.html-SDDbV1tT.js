In spite of my painful illness, I reiterate that for the sake of love, let me stay behind to drink down the last bitter cup of parting.</p><p>I hope to remain with my parents and Hexi in their lifetime and be the last to pass away. It would make me turn in my grave if I should be the first to die, thus leaving them with perpetual sorrow.
