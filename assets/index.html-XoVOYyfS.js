Firstly, „我们“ occurs five times, which is a duplicate expression in Chinese. Second, as a typical parataxis language, Chinese does not necessarily require specific logical connections. Thirdly, the original sentence is formal and poetic, but the translation is relatively casual („如果……就“, „不敢“).</p><p>A possible better translation is „团结一心，我们将在共同事业中创造无限可能；分裂割据，我们将一筹莫展——因为我们无法在分歧和纷争中应对强劲挑战。“</p>',10),d=[n];function s(i,h){return t(),o("div",null,d)}const l=e(r,[["render",s],["__file","index.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
