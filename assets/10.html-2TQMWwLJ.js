It was six or seven years ago, no longer after I came to Shanghai to study. Tons of homework was assigned, and midnight study was often required. It rained a lot that year, and while reading I was often annoyed by the sounds of raindrops hitting windows or sliding on tiles. Though I was not like Qiming the elder, saying „unblessed rain“ and sighing, „I hate rain“ was, of course, coming to my head.</p><p>This feeling, however, only appears in Shanghai. When I was young living in my hometown, the spring raindrops fell like soft feathers. Stand high and see far away, the mountains were half hidden behind the smoke-like light rains, hard to say whether they can be seen or not. Fresh and silent was the unforgettable plain in the rain. Rains at night were even sweeter. One spring my two friends and I went to a ten-kilometer-away town to watch a movie. The return was at night, in the rain. Above the small river, our boat moved forward slowly. It was so dark that we can’t recognize each other. It was so beautiful that the sounds came from cogongrass at the bank touching the boat. It was so wonderful that the music played by raindrops and the boat roofs as if natives singing in strong melody. It was so attractive that the scene was like an ancient poem.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji</summary><p>I remember when I first came to Shanghai to attend school six or seven years ago, I used to be so very busy with my homework that I often had to sit up late into the night. As it happened to be a rainy year, I was often disturbed by the pitter-patter of rain beating down against the window and roof. Indeed, I dislike rain with no less intensity than the elderly gentleman Qi Ming*, who sits about moaning about the wet weather all day in his study, over the doorway of which hangs a horizontal board bearing an inscription in his own hand, “Distressing-Rain Study”.</p><p>But that’s something which can be experienced in Shanghai only. I’ll never forget the days when I enjoyed the spring rain in my native place as a small child. I would go upstairs to take a distant look. The faraway mountains were veiled in a misty rain. The villages were now visible, now invisible. The wet open country was fresh and serene. And the rainy evening was even more lovely. One spring, together with two companions, I rowed a small boat to a townlet ten li away to see a village opera. At midnight, after the performance was over, we got caught in a rain on the way home. The boat made its way slowly and our faces were hardly distinguishable by the dim light of the lantern. Rustles were heard as the boat rubbed its body against the newly grown green grass by the river bank. The rain beating on the awning gave off a pleasant sound, as if with musical rhythm and cadence. My companions began to sing, to the accompaniment of the drip-drop, the local folk song In a Boat by a Bridge on a Rainy Night. It was truly fascinating.</p></details><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Kommentare</p><ol><li>“岂明老人”指作家周作人(字岂明)，故译 the elderly gentleman QiMing，译文中须另加注释。</li><li>“天天坐在里面嘘气”意即“整天坐在书房里唉声叹气”，译为 sits about moaning all day in his study，其中 moaning 相当于 sighing。又，成语 to sit about 的意思是“懒洋洋地闲坐”(to sit doing nothing),内涵与 to sit 略有不同。</li><li>“村落恍惚，若有若无”意同“村落忽隐忽现”，译为 The villages were now visible. now invisible，其中 now … now …是习语，作“时而……时而……”解。</li><li>“和着同伴们土著的歌谣”意即“伴随着同伴们唱的地方歌谣”。译时可颠倒过来，按“伴随着雨声，同伴们唱起一支地方歌谣……”处理：Mycompanions began to sing, to the accompaniment of the drip-drop, the local folk song，其中 to the accompaniment of 是成语，作“在……伴奏下”解。</li></ol></div><h2 id="notizen-zum-fernkurs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notizen-zum-fernkurs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notizen zum Fernkurs</h2><p><code>string</code></p><h2 id="notizen-zum-more-to-read" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notizen-zum-more-to-read" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notizen zum <em>More to Read</em></h2><p><code>string</code></p>',11),s=[o];function r(h,d){return a(),n("div",null,s)}const c=e(i,[["render",r],["__file","10.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
