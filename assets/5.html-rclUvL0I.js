In general, it’s better not to marry when perchasing houses, working for higher govenment, or writting especially entailling someone’s wife. But to get ready for marrying, money, time, job etc., are required as the Five, which is also not easy to quisis.

Charles Lamb, also a single man, in A Bachelor’s Complaint of the Behaviour of Married People, one of his essays signed „Elia“, speaks mockingly of married people with their inevitable postnuptial fruits — the children.</p><p>Marriage or no marriage, which is more desirable? That sounds like the chicken-and-egg question, which, though often discussed, remains a perpetual puzzle. Generally speaking, one who has no family dependants is not supposed to rent a house, one who has no petticoat influence in the government should refrain from becoming an official, an unmarried malewriter is in no position to write about „my wife“. All these seem to hint at the advantages of marriage. But, to get married, you need to have five prerequisites, namely, money, leisure, employment, good looks and potentness, of which all are not always available. What is more, after your marriage, your offspring will come to this world of themselves. And in a world with overpopulation, economic crisis, educational bankruptcy and deteriorating public morals, they may, just as Charles Lamb says, through their own acts of indiscretion, be sent to the gallows.
