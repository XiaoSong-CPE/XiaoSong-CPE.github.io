For the spiritual exploration workers who support the superstructure of the spiritual circle and its regime and power relations, ideology mainly uses the way of guidance and guidance to ignite their creative enthusiasm, so as to serve the expansion and deepening of ideology. For the spirit workers who can unite and are not in the same line temporarily, the way of channelling is used; For the emergence of various ideas and works at any time, often in the way of supervision; For non-ideological and anti-ideological people and opinions, especially when they threaten or even destroy ideology, in many cases, they will strike, destroy or destroy their spiritual banner, maintain the superstructure to which they belong, and embody their will to power through other forces of the superstructure.</p><h4 id="basic-spirit" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-spirit" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Basic spirit:</h4><p>On the other hand, ideological connotation is the basic spirit within the scope of its spiritual form itself.
