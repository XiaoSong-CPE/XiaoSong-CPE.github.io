He looked outside through the train window and said: “I’ll buy you some oranges. You just stay here. Don’t go around.” On the opposite side of the platform, there were several sellers beyond the fence, waiting for their customers. To reach there, father had to go across the railroad by jumping down and climbing up. It was not easy for him to do so as a fat person. I should have bought them myself but Father insisted, so I let him go. I saw him under a black-clothed hat, in a black-clothed coat and deep green-cotton cover, staggering to near the railroad and dropping his body down, which was not quite hard for him yet. But it was not easy for him to cross the railroad and climb up onto the opposite platform. His two hands grasped the upper ground, and his feet stretched up. His fat shape tipped slightly to the left, trying hard. Seeing his back, my tears dripped soon at that time. To avoid being seen by him and the others, I quickly wiped them off. When I looked outside again, Father had already taken oranges on his chest. While crossing the railroad, he first put the oranges on the ground, then slowly climbed down himself, and finally took the oranges away. I hurriedly went to hold him by the arm soon as he reached this side of the platform. He and I backed to the train and put all the oranges in my cover at once. Father wiped the dirt on his cloth, as if this was a piece of cake. A while later, he said:„I’m leaving. Write to me in Peking.“ I watched his leaving. He walked a few steps, stoped, turned his face to me, and said:„Go inside. Nobody’s there.“ When his back merged into passerbys and can not be found any more, I went inside and sitted down. Tears flowed again.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Bing AI-Version</summary><p>I said to him, “Dad, you can go now.” He glanced out of the window and said, “I’ll buy some oranges for you. You stay here and don’t wander off.” I saw a few vendors outside the fence on the opposite platform, waiting for customers. To get there, he had to cross the railroad by jumping down and climbing up. My father was a fat man and it would take some effort for him to do so. I wanted to go myself but he wouldn’t let me. I had to let him go. I saw him wearing a black cloth hat and a black cloth coat over a dark green cotton robe. He staggered to the edge of the railroad and slowly lowered himself down. That was not too hard for him yet. But it was not easy for him to cross the railroad and climb up onto the opposite platform. He grasped the upper ground with both hands and lifted his feet up. His body leaned slightly to the left, showing his struggle. At that moment, I saw his back and my tears came down quickly. I hurriedly wiped them off, afraid that he would see them or that others would see them. When I looked out again, he was already holding oranges against his chest. While crossing the railroad, he first put the oranges on the ground, then climbed down slowly himself, and then picked up the oranges again. When he reached this side of the platform, I quickly went to help him by his arm. He and I walked back to the train and dumped all the oranges on my leather coat at once. He dusted off his clothes as if it was easy for him and after a while he said,“I’m leaving now; write me when you get there!” I watched him walk away. He took a few steps, stopped, turned around and saw me; he said,“Go inside; there’s nobody in there.” When his back disappeared into the crowd of people coming and going and could no longer be seen; I went inside and sat down; my tears came again.</p></details><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji</summary><p>I said, „Dad, you might leave now.“ But he looked out of the window and said, „I’m going to buy you some tangerines. You just stay here. Don’t move around.“ I caught sight of several vendors waiting for customers outside the railings beyond a platform. But to reach that platform would require crossing the railway track and doing some climbing up and down. That would be a strenuous job for father, who was fat. I wanted to do all that myself, but he stopped me, so I could do nothing but let him go. I watched him hobble towards the railway track in his black skullcap, black cloth mandarin jacket and dark blue cotton-padded cloth long gown. He had little trouble climbing down the railway track, but it was a lot more difficult for him to climb up that platform after crossing the railway track. His hands held onto the upper part of the platform, his legs huddled up and his corpulent body tipped slightly towards the left, obviously making an enormous exertion. While I was watching him from behind, tears gushed from my eyes. I quickly wiped them away lest he or others should catch me crying. The next moment when I looked out of the window again, father was already on the way back, holding bright red tangerines in both hands. In crossing the railway track, he first put the tangerines on the ground, climbed down slowly and then picked them up again. When he came near the train, I hurried out to help him by the hand. After boarding the train with me, he laid all the tangerines on my overcoat, and patting the dirt off his clothes, he looked somewhat relieved and said after a while, „I must be going now. Don’t forget to write me from Beijing!“ I gazed after his backretreating out of the carriage. After a few steps, he looked back at me and said, „Go back to your seat. Don’t leave your things alone.“ I, however, did not go back to my seat until his figure was lost among crowds of people hurrying to and fro and no longer visible. My eyes were again wet with tears.</p></details><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Kommentare</p><p>谢谢你的译文。我会从以下几个方面来点评：</p><ul><li>语法：译文的语法基本上是正确的，没有明显的错误。但是有一些地方可以改进，比如： <ul><li>“You just stay here.
