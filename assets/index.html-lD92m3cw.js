She prays for a miracle to make this happen.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What does she think when she has gone crazy?</strong><ul><li>After being raped by her father and becoming pregnant with his child, Pecola goes insane. She believes that she has finally received her blue eyes and that everyone is now envious of her beauty.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What is the end of the story?</strong><ul><li>The end of the story is tragic. Pecola’s baby dies shortly after birth and she becomes an outcast in the community. She spends the rest of her life talking to herself and an imaginary friend about her blue eyes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What do you think of the three themes — love is never any better than the lover</strong><ul><li>“Love is never any better than the lover” means that the quality of love depends on the person giving it. This theme is shown in the relationship between Pecola and her parents, who are unable to love her properly because they are damaged individuals.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Describe the three characters in the story — Pecola, Geraldine and Junior.</strong><ul><li><strong>Pecola</strong>: A little black girl who is always alone at school. She seems to like non-human creatures (attracted to kittens) and is not very brave (prone to crying and not able to tell the truth).</li><li><strong>Geraldine</strong>: A light-skinned black woman who considers herself and her family superior to other black families. Her only real affection is for her cat.</li><li><strong>Junior</strong>: A light-skinned little black boy who is the son of Geraldine. He is a mischievous school bully with high self-esteem (do not tell the truth about being beaten up by black girls).</li></ul></li><li><strong>What is the implication of the sentence: „Grass wouldn’t grow where they lived. Flowers died. Shades fell down. Tin cans and tires blossomed where they lived.“</strong><ul><li><strong>„Grass wouldn’t grow where they lived“</strong> and <strong>„Flowers died“</strong> using personification suggests that living things could hardly survive where black children lived, implying that it’s the environment that makes black children look disgusting (para. 48) or behave indecently, rather than their skin colour or something at birth.</li><li><strong>„Shades fell down“</strong> refers to broken window shades or blinds, symbolizing the black children’s life is lack of sunlight and relatively isolated from other children group.</li><li><strong>„Tin cans and tires blossomed“</strong> presents an ironic contrast between the natural beauty of the plants and the presence of man-made waste such as „tin cans and tires“. This implies that it’s white superiority (man-made waste) that prevents black children from having a normal life (grass and flowers).</li><li>(<u>Note that all the words or terms used above have nothing to do with linguistics!</u>)</li></ul></li></ul>',5),g={id:"summary-of-a-video",tabindex:"-1"},c=e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#summary-of-a-video","aria-hidden":"true"},"#",-1),u={href:"https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTEyMjk4MigxNg==.html",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=o("<ul><li><strong>Novel Plot</strong>: A young black girl, whose family instilled in her the notion of ‚white aesthetics‘, believes her prayers for blue eyes have been answered, causing cause her to become delusional.</li><li><strong>Writting Background</strong>: <em>The Bluest Eye</em> is political in nature, reflecting the cultural politics of the late 1960s and 1970s.</li><li><strong>Questions</strong><ul><li>Why Toni Morrison chose to write a novel instead of a tract or becoming a sociologist or politician? <ul><li>To allow the voices of the oppressed to speak in a way that they could not otherwise. <ul><li>Morrison writes from within a black community she knows well.</li><li>Fiction gives a way to get at what traditional academics cannot transmit about the past.</li><li>Morrison has the ability to embody the voice, which is one of the great strengths of her writing.</li></ul></li><li>To push the boundaries of what’s credible and see the abject clearly within a literary form. <ul><li>Set the protagonist of Pecola, an ugly child with no redeeming intelligence and no one who loves her.</li><li>Set the background in a specific historical moment with specific historical and political connotations and implications.</li></ul></li><li>To generate sympathy, even for characters who have committed terrible acts. <ul><li>Cholly is a drunk and raped his own daughter.</li><li>Cholly experienced a miserable past.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Does sentiment remain important in Morison’s work despite the irony and humor? <ul><li>Yes.
