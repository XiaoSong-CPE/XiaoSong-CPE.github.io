The hand of the clock appears to be „still“ at first glance, but it’s actually one of the most constantly moving objects made by humans. In daily life, we always feel that we’re ourselves and that this „me“ will never change, but in reality, just like the hand of the clock, we are impermanent! As long as we are still breathing, we still think we’re the same person, that we haven’t changed, and we’re still attached to our lives, but we are pitifully deceived by „gradual“ changes!</p><p>The essence of „gradual“ is „time“. Most people only have enough understanding of time to manage short periods, such as taking a boat or riding in a car. They cannot handle a lifespan of a hundred years and are often trapped locally without considering the whole situation. For example, look at the passengers on a train. Some wise people sacrifice their temporary comfort and offer their seats to weaker passengers in order to achieve inner peace (or gain temporary admiration). Others see people competing to get off the train and step back, shouting, &quot;Don’t rush, there will always be people getting off!” “Everyone has to get off!” However, wise people like this are rarely seen among the long-term travelers of life who ride the big train of „society“ or the „world“. That’s why I think a lifespan of a hundred years is too long. If people in today’s world had a shorter lifespan, perhaps many dangerous and brutal struggles in human society could be reduced. Whether the same level of politeness and peace seen on trains can be achieved is also unknown.</p><details class="custom-container details"><summary>Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji</summary><p>I think the clock is most symbolic of life. It normally seems to be &quot;still” at first sight, but, of all things artificially made, it is the most busy with its hands moving all the time. The same is true of life. We are apt to think that we are forever our own selves and unchangeable, while in fact we are ever-changing like the hands of a clock. Alas, as long as we are alive, we are completely fooled by „gradualness“ into believing that we will always remain the same and unchangeable, and therefore becoming only too ready to hold on to this life!</p><p>“Time” is the essence of “gradualness”. Ordinary people have only a superficial understanding of time. They seem to know it only as regards such small matters as boarding a train or boat, but not in things concerning a lifetime. They see the trees, but not the wood. Take the passengers of a train for example. Often some passengers are sensible and considerate enough to offer their own seats to the elderly or handicapped so that they themselves can enjoy peace of mind or momentary public praise. Some, when they see other passengers falling over one another in getting off the train, purposely make room by staying behind, or call out, „Don’t squeeze! We’ll all make it! Nobody will be left behind!“ But few will be as sensible and considerate when making the long journey of life on board a big &quot;social” or &quot;global” train. Therefore, I wish man would live a much shorter life. If their lifespan could become as brief as the time they spent on a train or a boat, human society would probably witness far less bitter strife, and people would be as polite and modest as on the train.</p></details><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Kommentare</p><ol><li>“往往迷于局部而不能顾及全体”译为 They often see the trees, but notthe wood，其中 see the trees, but not the wood 是成语 not to see the wood for the trees（见树不见林/只见细节不见全面）的变体。</li></ol></div><h2 id="notizen-zum-fernkurs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notizen-zum-fernkurs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notizen zum Fernkurs</h2><p><code>string</code></p><h2 id="notizen-zum-more-to-read" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notizen-zum-more-to-read" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notizen zum <em>More to Read</em></h2><p><code>string</code></p>',11),r=[s];function i(l,h){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const c=e(n,[["render",i],["__file","9.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
