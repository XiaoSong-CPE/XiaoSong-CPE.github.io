Before constructing each subway line, the government assigns ownership of the undeveloped land along the line to the company. Once the subway is operational, any increase in land value goes to the company. This approach has allowed the company to benefit from the appreciation of land values along its routes, thus generating significant revenue.</p><p>In addition, the MTR has developed commercial and residential properties around its stations. This has created new communities centered around the subway stations, thereby increasing property values and generating additional income for the company. The value-added from these properties has been a significant source of revenue for the company.</p><p>Another strategy implemented by the government for the MTR is self-pricing. The company has the autonomy to set ticket prices independently without government intervention. However, before setting the price, the company engages in discussions with stakeholders to ensure that the prices are fair. The pricing policy is tied to inflation rates, ensuring that the ticket prices keep up with costs while remaining affordable. This approach allows the company to generate enough revenue to cover its operating costs and provide investors with reasonable returns.</p><p>Finally, the MTR has introduced market-oriented strategies to its operations. Although owned by the government, the subway is operated like a private enterprise. The government delegates a board of directors to manage the subway’s construction, operation, and daily management. The company operates independently, without government subsidies or interference. In addition, the company has been partially privatized and listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. This has allowed the company to raise additional capital and enhance its financial independence.</p><h4 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Conclusion</h4><p>The MTR provides an excellent example of how megacities can achieve profitability in their subway systems. The key strategies include combining real estate development with subway construction, increasing property values around subway stations, self-pricing, and introducing market-oriented strategies. The MTR’s success may inspire other megacities to adopt similar strategies to make their subways profitable and sustainable.</p><h4 id="acknowledgment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#acknowledgment" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Acknowledgment</h4><p>I would like to express my gratitude to the GPT series for serving as my academic language guide and advanced English consultant.</p><h4 id="reference" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reference" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reference</h4><p>[1]史家宁.香港地铁盈利模式的正外部性分析[J].铁道运输与经济,2011,33(06):81-85.</p>',11);function K(B,J){const i=o("badge"),s=o("ECharts");return d(),h("div",null,[e("h2",l,[u,t(" Question 1 "),a(i,{text:"金贞贤"})]),p,m,f,e("h2",g,[y,t(" Question 2 "),a(i,{text:"金贞贤"})]),b,e("h2",w,[v,t(" Question 3 "),a(i,{text:"金贞贤"})]),_,T,x,k,q,M,e("h2",R,[P,t(" Question 4 "),a(i,{text:"林佳成"})]),z,W,e("h2",A,[C,t(" Question 5 "),a(i,{text:"周康"})]),H,U,E,F,a(s,{id:"echarts-152",config:"eJytkstLw0AQxu/+FcOCeMmhUnow4kEqtFJR0d6sh00yTRaTnbDZ9EHp/+7s5mEfghch2by++ea334RKq0jDHewuAKyyOYb+lh9wY0MQj/BA+srCTNMapnxagmdZINgMYe4KROD1OS6dPkZt0fh3e7dYotyqsnc1Kk3RsFBuVNWWuttXUq6w07FyWzKLqDKZ0LoVeke/5JiiTjp1Iq0M4UNMZRHVJg1ggqaQeisCEFPSKcx4CWCcKS3FZ+NliaGGg95xc88UPWbTPJYWUzLsc9imBRRzFX+hXeg3XKGuuxz4wwtnYxZ6TEWBJlYyhzPJhFZodMFhLfR7HVUq6Zp4PE+0/YVoJfPexsX2JCPMf0JbEu/b+hzFzmv3l2fZVWgUsnGzka5U81C56jzC43lEshnuQR6jUQDXgwCGozZaHs8xFvfMaB3y9GvsJAAlVcr9fezKw+hdPWN/OcU7nebfeDeMx8fg3+HYcH978Q032Nzn",type:"js"}),I])}const Q=r(c,[["render",K],["__file","Week_11-2.html.vue"]]);export{Q as default};
