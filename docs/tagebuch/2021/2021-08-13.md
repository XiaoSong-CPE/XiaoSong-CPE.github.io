# A Dream

I was sitting in a golden-color hall at the edge of the second floor. A girl, probably one of my classmates, walked to me and reminded me to check my WeChat. It was Wei Jundang who sent me a message half an hour ago! I looked down at Wei who was sitting on the first floor, and she turned back smiling at me. I said hi. She sent the message to invite me to watch a firecrackers show she prepared for me because of something about Pleasant Goat, my favorite cartoon. But the show had gone ten minutes before. I felt so regretful that I didn't check my WeChat in time and missed the date between me and Wei.
