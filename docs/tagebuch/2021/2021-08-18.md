# A Dream

I didn't sleep last night. I sleep from about 7:00 till now, 14:54. And had a dream at the end of the sleep. It was the second time that I dreamed about Wei Jundan recently.

I was so fall in love with Wei that, it seems like I kept doing one thing for her, maybe only keeping a diary about her, for four or five years. One day I was in my junior high school classroom, which is so crowded with people and books, and I don't remember whether she invited me or something, and I came to meet her. We wandered around in a shopping center or a subway underground shopping street. We chatted with each other, and both of us were very happy. When we were going to leave, she mentioned her husband unintentionally, and until now I just knew that she already had a husband! I was so disappointed, but, anyhow, we were not even friends after so many years without connection, she of course could have a husband. At the end of the dream, I came back to my classroom.
