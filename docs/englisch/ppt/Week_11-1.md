## Question 1 <badge text="周康" />

> 请分析哪个翻译更贴切?你有更好的翻译来挑战吗?
>
> 原文：In an epoch dominated by the aspirations of new states for national development, it is instructive to recall that the United States itself began as an underdeveloped country.
>
> 译文 1：在一个以新国家渴求国家富强为主旋律的时代，记住美国开始时也是一个不发达国家，是有启迪的。
>
> 译文 2：在一个以新诞生的国家渴求国家富强为主要特征的时代，想一下美国原来的不发达，会予人启发。
>
> 译文 3：新国家纷纷诞生，渴求国家富强，在这样一个时代，回顾一下美国的强国之路，不无启迪。
>
> 译文 4：在这样一个新国家纷纷诞生、渴求国家富强的时代，回顾一下美国的强国之路，颇为令人深思。

- 译文 1 和 2 基本使用直译方法，符合汉语欧化的语言趋势。
- 译文 3 为追求所谓汉语的“流水句”，强行把“在这样一个时代”独立成句，使句子逻辑关系混乱。
- 译文 4 使用“颇为令人深思”，将现代英语翻译为近现代汉语，是译者风格化的表现，未必能够满足大部分读者。

综上所述，这 4 种译文均有缺点。我的翻译：**在众多新生国家渴求实现繁荣富强的时代背景下，回顾美国的强国之路，或许有所启示。**

## Question 2 <badge text="周康" />

> 对比下面三个翻译，并在此基础上给出你们自己的翻译。

> 原文：Several elements seem fundamental to the philosophy which facilitated the rapid social and economic development of the American continent.
>
> 译文 1：有几个因素似乎对促进美国大陆的快速的社会经济发展的思想是最根本的。
>
> 译文 2：在促使美国社会经济迅速发展的思想体系中，似乎有几个根本因素。
>
> 译文 3：美国社会经济迅速发展，似乎得益于其思想体系中的几个根本因素。

- 译文 1 在单一句子中使用了大量定语，符合汉语欧化的语言趋势。
- 译文 2 和 3 基本符合汉语表达习惯，但译文 2 的意思与原文有偏差。

综上所述，译文 3 较好。我的翻译：**在一众哲学思想中，存在若干概念，其对美国社会经济的快速发展起到重要作用。**

## Question 3 <badge text="林佳成" />

> According to paragraph 4, do you think the concept applicable to China? Why (not)? (such as the strategy of economic development through science-technology and education)

Yes, I do.

Science and technology is the primary productive force, and scientific and technological progress is the decisive factor in economic development. With the development of social productive forces, the function of science and technology in social production is more and more important, and all elements of productive forces are closely linked with certain science and technology. In addition, education is the foundation of scientific and technological progress. Scientific and technological progress, economic development and national rejuvenation fundamentally depend on improving the quality of workers and cultivating talents. Therefore, economic development depends on science and technology education, which must be combined with economic development, and transfer economic construction to the track of relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the quality of labor force.

Reviewing the economic development of China, knowledge education is indispensable. After the decade-long Cultural Revolution, the social thought at that time was chaotic, and the wrong view of "two whatever"(Whatever Chairman Mao decides, we will resolutely uphold all; whatever Chairman Mao instructs, we will unswervingly follow all. ) occupied a dominant position, creating new spiritual shackles for the masses, and severely restricting people's thoughts and behaviors. People worked in a stiff and dead manner in real life, and a variety of rules seriously imprisoned the thoughts of people, which made a lot of things not develop as its objective law. As a result, the economic construction as well as people's lives could not improve, and the national economy went to the edge of the collapse. However, all this made a major change and breakthrough from the restart of the college entrance examination.

President Deng Xiaoping, with his superb political wisdom, used the simplest method, the lowest social cost, and the most accurate social entry point to liberate the mind and restore social fairness mechanisms through the restoration of the college entrance examination. He also cleverly repaired the relationship between the government and the people, reigniting the enthusiasm of the whole country to trust the CPC and the government, and to be willing to work together with the CPC and the government in times of crisis. ^[戴家干.历史的抉择与时代的任务一纪念恢复高考制度30周年.中国考试。2007.8:4.]

Subsequently, President Deng Xiaoping made a major decision to implement reform and opening up at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1978, which made China's development seem to have entered a fast lane. The continuous introduction of advanced foreign technology and funds, as well as the continuous development of domestic technology, led to the rapid rise of the Chinese economy. In the practice of reform and opening up and the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the CPC and the country have also recognized the importance of knowledge and have always regarded education and technology as the cornerstone of the modernization process. In 1995, the proposal of the strategy of revitalizing the country through science and education further confirmed the first sentence of the fourth paragraph in the article, "Modern industrial society must be above all a literal society."
In the history of human social development, every major breakthrough in science and technology will lead to a huge leap in productivity and profound changes in social life. Numerous historical facts strongly prove a profound truth: the prosperity of science and education is the strength of the country.^[周丽华. 科教兴国是经济增长的源泉[J]. 新疆社科论坛，2002,02: 43 -45.] "Science is a revolutionary force that plays a role in promoting history." this force can fundamentally change the mode of production and people's way of thinking, and even change the international pattern.

## Question 4 <badge text="金贞贤" />

> Defination of ideology?

- History
- Definition
- Status
- Constituent elements
- Strategic tasks
- Countries around the world

### History

In Chinese history, three dominant ideologies are the most representative: feudalism, the Three Principles of the People and socialism. The most prominent ideologies in the West can be listed as six: imperial thought in Ancient Greece and Rome (after the establishment of the city-state), theology, humanism, rationalism, capitalism, socialism. It was in the 19th and 20th centuries that thousands of "isms" appeared in the West, mostly at the level of general spirit, culture and art, but rarely at the level of ideology, which was determined by their relationship with social structure and political system. The most representative ideologies in the world are capitalism and socialism. The two ideologies have consolidated and evolved in relation to the regime. The socialist ideology has become an important part of the socialist system and interpersonal relations. ^[张首映. 意识形态释义[N]. 人民网-人民日报新闻研究网, 2011-04-22.]

### Definition

Ideology is the spiritual form of a certain political community or social community. Ideology shows its significance and function in political community and social community, so many foreign studies on ideology often put it in the political structure and social structure, or in political science and sociology. A political party and regime, especially in modern times, is inconceivable without ideology. Its party constitution, political program and system not only define the nature of ideology, but also the product of ideology.

### Status

The status of ideology is determined by the superstructure of political community and social community. It is an important part of the superstructure to which it belongs. The status, function and power of the superstructure determine the status, function and power of ideology. The superstructure should not only reflect the economic basic system, but also be located in the decision-making, power, power protection, self-establishment and improvement of the upper echelon of the whole society. Therefore, the ideology it belongs to not only has the significance of directly or indirectly interacting with the economic basic system, but also has the significance of directly generating benefits for the consolidation, development and improvement of the superstructure.

### Constituent elements

The constituent elements of ideology mainly refer to the constituent elements of its spiritual form, which is the expansion of the spiritual attributes of ideology and the definition of its connotation.

#### Superstructure

There are various ways for ideology to embody the relations of power and regime, including guiding, guiding, channeling, supervising, attacking, destroying and eliminating. For the spiritual exploration workers who support the superstructure of the spiritual circle and its regime and power relations, ideology mainly uses the way of guidance and guidance to ignite their creative enthusiasm, so as to serve the expansion and deepening of ideology. For the spirit workers who can unite and are not in the same line temporarily, the way of channelling is used; For the emergence of various ideas and works at any time, often in the way of supervision; For non-ideological and anti-ideological people and opinions, especially when they threaten or even destroy ideology, in many cases, they will strike, destroy or destroy their spiritual banner, maintain the superstructure to which they belong, and embody their will to power through other forces of the superstructure.

#### Basic spirit

On the other hand, ideological connotation is the basic spirit within the scope of its spiritual form itself. This is a particular aspect which is connected with the political superstructure, but which is quite different. As the spiritual form of the superstructure, ideology has a very wide range of contents and numerous categories, stipulating that its spiritual essence should not only be correspondingly extensive, but also highly concentrated.

#### Anti-ideology

The social level of anti-ideology has a specific meaning. It also has a distinct and determined ideology, but it is not orthodox, it is anti-orthodox. Orthodoxy refers to the dominant ideology in the social structure and is considered to be correct and authentic. Those who oppose such dominant ideology which is considered to be correct and authentic generally belong to the anti-ideology category.

### Strategic tasks

To build a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and guidance, we must also keep pace with The Times, keep to the current, and constantly improve the quality and level of our work. The object of ideological work is human beings, and it is to work in the ideological and spiritual fields of human beings. We must study the law of activities of human thoughts and spirits, study the relationship between changes in people's ideas and social environment and educational guidance, find the pulse of social thoughts, and grasp the topics, contents and key points of publicity and education. We should better combine ideological work with the new changes in people's spiritual life. ^[甄占民. 意识形态工作强起来的战略任务[J]. 求是, 2018(20).]

### Countries around the world

#### Germany

The German Ideology is a classic document co-written by Marx and Engels, the founders of Marxist classics, and also the second work jointly written by them after The Holy Family. Based on the above review of Marx, it can be seen that the main purpose of their writing of the German Ideology was to clarify the opposition between their views and the ideological views of German philosophy, and actually to completely liquidate their former philosophical beliefs. ^[Marx K, Engels F. Die deutsche Ideologie [M]. Bluhm H, 编. Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010.]

#### Russia

Russia is an ideological nation and state. It means, above all, that ideology is essential to Russia, as the core means of integrating the empire, short of force. Thus, when the new Russia abandoned state ideology in the form of a constitution, it was destined that it would soon return to the search for a new ideology. Russia's search for "national thought" in the mid-1990s and early 2000s was a return. Secondly, ideology is the core element that makes Russia Russia and thus distinguishes it from other peoples and states. In terms of its ideological program content, "Neoconservatism" is a synthesis of the previous "new ideas" and "sovereign democracy", not much new content, but it increasingly reflects Russia's trend toward isolationism. ^[张昊琦. 俄国孤立主义：意识形态与历史心理[J]. 俄罗斯东欧中亚研究, 2016(1).]

#### United States

From the end of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century, the ideological polarization of the contemporary United States appeared. The ideological polarization of the United States is increasing. The left-wing liberalism based on the Democratic Party, which emphasizes free trade, feminism, legalization of same-sex marriage, egalitarianism and globalization, is in sharp contrast to the right-wing conservatism based on the Republican Party. On the other hand, right-wing conservatism is polarized by its views on trade protection, white supremacy, anti-homosexuality, anti-immigration, and anti-globalization. The ideological polarization of the contemporary United States is distributed in various fields, including democratic socialism and conservatism in the economic field, party polarization, elite polarization and popular polarization in the political field. The key areas of polarization are still in the cultural aspect. Ideological polarization is very serious in various fields such as race, morality, religion, education and language. At the same time, this polarization also unfolds in the level of global communication, forming an all-round picture of ideological polarization. The ideological polarization of the contemporary United States has a very complex root, among which the main reason is the decline of the leading role of liberalism. ^[佟德志. 当代美国意识形态的极化现象及其根源[J]. 探索与争鸣, 2020(9).]
