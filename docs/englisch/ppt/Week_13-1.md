## Question 1 <badge text="Lin Jiacheng" />

> Why do ideologists prevent free flow of ideas?

From the author’s point of view, by ideology he means a body of systematic and rigid dogma by which people seek to understand the world — and to preserve or transform it. However, the ideologists push this concept to the extreme and stress its exclusiveness and absoluteness. 

We should know that ideologist is a group of people who understand and explain the world with ideas and thoughts divorced from the reality. Ideologists in the spiritual field try hard to interpret life through language, but their language expression only focuses on the research and elaboration of ideas and concepts, which is the main reason for making language separate from real life and become a philosophical language (rather than a life language). First of all, in their eyes, the world refers to the conceptual (spiritual) world rather than the world of our real life. They focus on the abstract people in the spiritual world, ignoring the real life foundation reflected by people and their consciousness; And the way they transform the world is just to use words and sentences to oppose words and sentences, and to criticize ideas with ideas, so what they oppose is only the idea world expressed by words and sentences, and the philosophy on which the idea world is based lacks attention to the real life of the society. ^[廖伟凯.马克思如何认识、使用与定义“Ideologe”——对《德意志意识形态》特别是“圣麦克斯章”的考察[J].哲学动态,2022,(02):14-23.]

Therefore, when thoughts flow, new ideologies will arise to oppose the system those ideologists previously adhered to, which is not conducive to their interpretation and structure of the world. Moreover, because the ideologists' own views are divorced from reality, they can not make a powerful response to emerging ideas, so they can only kill the collision and flow of ideas in the cradle.

## Question 3 <badge text="Jin Zhenxian" />

> Please comment on the following statements: Their objective remains that of making the world over in the image of their dogmatic ideology. (Para. 21)

Their objective is laughable.

The essence of making the world over in the image of a dogmatic ideology lies in the desire to impose a rigid set of beliefs and principles on society, disregarding alternative perspectives and diversity. It involves shaping the world according to a specific worldview that may be intolerant of dissent and resistant to change. 

The danger of such an endeavor is multi-faceted: 

**Suppression of individual freedoms**: Dogmatic ideologies often prioritize conformity and restrict individual freedoms, autonomy, and personal choices. This can lead to a lack of personal agency and hinder the development of diverse and flourishing individuals within society. 

**Stifling of critical thinking**: Dogmatic ideologies discourage questioning and critical examination of their principles. This stifles intellectual growth and can impede progress by inhibiting the exploration of new ideas and solutions. 

**Intolerance and division**: The imposition of a dogmatic ideology can breed intolerance towards those who do not conform to its beliefs. This can create divisions within society, foster discrimination, and undermine social cohesion and harmony. 

**Inflexibility and resistance to change**: Dogmatic ideologies tend to resist adaptation and change, as they adhere to fixed principles. This can hinder societal progress by impeding the ability to respond effectively to evolving challenges and emerging needs. 

**Lack of pluralism and diversity**: The insistence on shaping the world solely in the image of a single dogmatic ideology undermines the value of diverse perspectives, cultures, and beliefs. It can result in the marginalization and erasure of alternative viewpoints, limiting the richness and potential of a diverse society. 

It is important to note that these dangers are not inherent to all ideologies but are specific to dogmatic ideologies that prioritize conformity and reject alternative viewpoints. Embracing openness, tolerance, critical thinking, and respect for diversity are crucial for fostering a world that celebrates individual freedoms, embraces pluralism, and promotes inclusive progress.
