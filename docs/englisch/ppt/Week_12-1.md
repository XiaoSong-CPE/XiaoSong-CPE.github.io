> 1. 也不能说美国从来没有过意识形态方面的诱惑——也就是说，以一种有序、全面、永恒的方式来确定国家目标的诱惑。
> 2. 美国也曾受过意识形态体系的诱惑，试图有条不紊、全面彻底、一劳永逸地确定国家目标。

1. While this translation effectively conveys the general meaning of the original sentence, it is somewhat literal and slightly difficult to understand. The translation uses phrases like "从来没有过" and "以一种有序、全面、永恒的方式," which may not be as clear or natural in Chinese.

2. This translation is more concise and easier to understand. It captures the essence of the original sentence while using more natural Chinese expressions like "试图有条不紊、全面彻底、一劳永逸地确定国家目标." This version reads more smoothly and is likely to be more accessible to a Chinese reader.

Overall, the second translation is more accurate and effective in conveying the meaning of the original sentence in a clear and natural manner.
