## Question 1 (GPT-4)

> Translation：So let us begin anew — remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.

让我们重新开始——双方都要牢记，文明礼让并非软弱的表现，真诚始终需要经得起检验。让我们永远不要因恐惧而谈判，但也永远不要害怕进行谈判。^[向 GPT-4 提供一篇中国领导人就职演说文稿，并要求其根据文稿风格进行翻译，重复 5 次，取每个短句的最佳译文拼接得到结果。]

## Question 2 (Zhou Kang)

> Implication：Let both sides unite to heed, in all corners of the earth, the command of Isaiah — to "undo the heavy burdens… (and) let the oppressed go free".

- **Positive interpretation:**
  - This sentence implies a call for unity and cooperation between nations to promote justice, alleviate suffering, and ensure freedom for all people.
  - JFK references the biblical prophet Isaiah to invoke a shared moral and ethical responsibility among nations to work together to "undo the heavy burdens" and "let the oppressed go free".
- **Negative interpretation:**
  - This sentence implies that the Bible (the teachings of Isaiah) is the only source of truth and guidance in the world.
  - While ostensibly advocating for global unity, it implicitly divides the world into dichotomies of righteousness and wickedness, oppressor and oppressed.

## Question 3 (Lin Jiacheng)

> 第 20 页 PPT，第 21 段的翻译是否准确？为什么？

> Original Sentence: The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.

> Translation: 许多美国青年响应号召参军作战，战死沙场。他们的坟墓遍及全球。

这个翻译不准确，因为此译文对原文进行了增译，即在“answered the call to service”这个短语时，译者翻译成“响应号召参军作战”，其主观性太强且理解稍有偏差。从文章前文的“let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law...”可以发现，“service”是指代维护世界和平安全，绝非战争打仗，两者的主体意识倾向是不同的。后文中“not as a call to battle”也再次印证非“作战”。原文是对和平事业做出奉献，而译文则是用武力来创造新世界。因此，该译文不适用。

参考译文：美国青年们响应号召，为事业献身。他们的坟墓遍及全球。

## Question 4 (Jin Zhenxian)

> According to para. 22, What is the nature of the struggle? Why does Kennedy call the struggle "a twilight struggle"?

It can be divided into three points:

- Initially, it is expected that the struggle will endure for a considerable duration.
- Second, we must be confident that this is a struggle that shall be triumphed.
- The third aspect concerns the challenges faced in this struggle, which requires the virtue of patience.

In his Inaugural Address, President John F. Kennedy referred to the ongoing conflict of the Cold War as a "twilight struggle." He used this phrase to describe the nature of the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union, which he believed was not only a geopolitical conflict but also a moral one. Kennedy called the Cold War a "twilight struggle" because it represented a battle between two opposing worldviews - democracy and communism. The conflict was not just about military might or economic power, but was also about the values and principles that each side represented. Kennedy believed that the struggle against communism was a moral one, and that the U.S. had a duty to defend democracy, freedom, and human rights around the world. Furthermore, Kennedy recognized that the Cold War was a complex and multi-faceted struggle that went beyond military confrontation. It involved issues such as poverty, disease, and tyranny, which were problems that affected people all over the world. By calling the conflict a "twilight struggle," Kennedy was acknowledging the long-term and ongoing nature of the conflict and the need for a sustained effort to win the battle against communism and promote democracy. In summary, Kennedy used the phrase "twilight struggle" to describe the Cold War as a moral battle between democracy and communism, recognizing the complexity of the conflict and the need for a sustained effort to promote freedom, human rights, and democracy around the world.
