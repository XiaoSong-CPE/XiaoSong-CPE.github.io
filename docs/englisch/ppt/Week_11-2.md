### How can Megacities Achieve Subway Profitability?

#### Introduction

Megacities are characterized by a high population density, which in turn poses transportation challenges. Building subways is one of the solutions to these challenges. While subways offer numerous benefits to megacities, they may also be unprofitable, leading to a reduction in other infrastructure projects. One successful example of a profitable subway system is the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR), which reported a net profit of HK$9.83 billion in 2022. This essay analyzes the MTR and recommends strategies that megacities can use to achieve profitability.

#### Analysis of the MTR

The MTR has adopted a profit-making model that combines real estate development and subway construction. Before constructing each subway line, the government assigns ownership of the undeveloped land along the line to the company. Once the subway is operational, any increase in land value goes to the company. This approach has allowed the company to benefit from the appreciation of land values along its routes, thus generating significant revenue.

In addition, the MTR has developed commercial and residential properties around its stations. This has created new communities centered around the subway stations, thereby increasing property values and generating additional income for the company. The value-added from these properties has been a significant source of revenue for the company.

Another strategy implemented by the government for the MTR is self-pricing. The company has the autonomy to set ticket prices independently without government intervention. However, before setting the price, the company engages in discussions with stakeholders to ensure that the prices are fair. The pricing policy is tied to inflation rates, ensuring that the ticket prices keep up with costs while remaining affordable. This approach allows the company to generate enough revenue to cover its operating costs and provide investors with reasonable returns.

Finally, the MTR has introduced market-oriented strategies to its operations. Although owned by the government, the subway is operated like a private enterprise. The government delegates a board of directors to manage the subway's construction, operation, and daily management. The company operates independently, without government subsidies or interference. In addition, the company has been partially privatized and listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. This has allowed the company to raise additional capital and enhance its financial independence.

#### Conclusion

The MTR provides an excellent example of how megacities can achieve profitability in their subway systems. The key strategies include combining real estate development with subway construction, increasing property values around subway stations, self-pricing, and introducing market-oriented strategies. The MTR's success may inspire other megacities to adopt similar strategies to make their subways profitable and sustainable.
