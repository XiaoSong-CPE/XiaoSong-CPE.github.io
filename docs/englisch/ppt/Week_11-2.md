## Question 1 <badge text="金贞贤" />

> According to the title, what are the "one" and "many" referring to?

They refer to "one viewpoint" and "many viewpoints".

"One" refers to a single abstract system of interpretation which is the same thing as ideology. Ideology is contrasted with pragmatism as the "one" with the "many". The author regards pragmatism as the key factor which contributed to the rapid development of the US.

## Question 2 <badge text="金贞贤" />

> Work out the outline and general meaning of each part.

Part Ⅰ (para. 1)
: American experience in achieving rapid national development.

Part Ⅱ (para. 2-6)
: The factors that facilitated the rapid social and economic development of the United States.

Part Ⅲ (para. 7-10)
: Difference between pragmatism and ideology.

Part Ⅳ (para. 11-12)
: An example of the distinction between ideals and ideology.

Part Ⅴ (para. 13-14)
: What is wrong with ideology?

Part Ⅵ (para. 15-19)
: Differences between the ideologist and the pragmatist in their views of history and in their approaches to issues of public policy.

Part Ⅶ (para. 20-22)
: Conclusion: The "many" should be the choice.

## Question 3 <badge text="金贞贤" />

> Do you agree that the basic conflict of our times is the conflict between the one and the many? Why or why not?

I concur with this perspective.

Most theorists in the 19th century favored a "unitary" state with a single religion, ethnicity and identity. After the end of imperialism, however, multiculturalism was essential for peace. Redrawn borders, uncontrolled migration and a rapidly expanding religion made uniformity impossible. Outdated racism makes homogenizing measures almost impossible and morally indefensible. Countries that are still struggling for ethnic purity or cultural conformity will encounter a traumatic period of "ethnic cleansing," which is a late 20th-century euphemism for strings of tears and merciless slaughter. Meanwhile, rival ideologies compete in democracies, and the only way to keep them at peace is political pluralism — allowing parties with perhaps irreconcilable views to enter the political arena on an equal footing.

Great empires have always contained different peoples with very different ways of life. However, usually, each empire had one dominant culture, and other cultures had to accommodate it. In the 20th century, inclusion was not enough. Hostility feeds dogmatism: If opposed, people insist that only their own views are correct. People need an enemy to revile and worry about if they want to rally advocates for irrational propositions. But in a multicultural society, a multicultural world shaped by mass immigration and frequent cultural exchanges, hatred is becoming harder to bear. We need ideas that bring peace and cooperation. We need to diversify. Hence, the conflict between the "one" and the "many" has existed.

### How can Megacities Achieve Subway Profitability?

#### Introduction

Megacities are characterized by a high population density, which in turn poses transportation challenges. Building subways is one of the solutions to these challenges. While subways offer numerous benefits to megacities, they may also be unprofitable, leading to a reduction in other infrastructure projects. One successful example of a profitable subway system is the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (MTR), which reported a net profit of HK$9.83 billion in 2022. This essay analyzes the MTR and recommends strategies that megacities can use to achieve profitability.

#### Analysis of the MTR

The MTR has adopted a profit-making model that combines real estate development and subway construction. Before constructing each subway line, the government assigns ownership of the undeveloped land along the line to the company. Once the subway is operational, any increase in land value goes to the company. This approach has allowed the company to benefit from the appreciation of land values along its routes, thus generating significant revenue.

In addition, the MTR has developed commercial and residential properties around its stations. This has created new communities centered around the subway stations, thereby increasing property values and generating additional income for the company. The value-added from these properties has been a significant source of revenue for the company.

Another strategy implemented by the government for the MTR is self-pricing. The company has the autonomy to set ticket prices independently without government intervention. However, before setting the price, the company engages in discussions with stakeholders to ensure that the prices are fair. The pricing policy is tied to inflation rates, ensuring that the ticket prices keep up with costs while remaining affordable. This approach allows the company to generate enough revenue to cover its operating costs and provide investors with reasonable returns.

Finally, the MTR has introduced market-oriented strategies to its operations. Although owned by the government, the subway is operated like a private enterprise. The government delegates a board of directors to manage the subway's construction, operation, and daily management. The company operates independently, without government subsidies or interference. In addition, the company has been partially privatized and listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. This has allowed the company to raise additional capital and enhance its financial independence.

#### Conclusion

The MTR provides an excellent example of how megacities can achieve profitability in their subway systems. The key strategies include combining real estate development with subway construction, increasing property values around subway stations, self-pricing, and introducing market-oriented strategies. The MTR's success may inspire other megacities to adopt similar strategies to make their subways profitable and sustainable.
