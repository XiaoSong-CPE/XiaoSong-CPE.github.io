## Question 1 <badge text="Jin Zhenxian" />

> Answer the following two questions in paragraph 14:
>
> Question1: Does the author really think the ideologist has committed a sin?
>
> Question2: Why is reality unpredictable, untidy?

### Question 1.1

No, it was just a humoristic way and sin here refers to fault or unfavorable practices. The author points out that ideologists confuse ideology, an abstruction of reality, with reality itself. This confusion leads to two bad results, in the interpretation of history and the choice of public policy.

### Question 1.2

#### Reasons

| **Marxists**                          | Things should be understood from the perspective of development, rather than from the perspective of stagnation and stillness. Only people's social practice is the standard for the truth about the outside world. If people want to achieve the work that is to get the expected results, they must make their thoughts conform to the regularity of the objective world. If not, they will fail in practice. After failure, people will learn lessons from failure and correct their thoughts to adapt them to the laws of the outside world. Then they can turn failure into victory. This is the so-called "mother of success for losers" and "A fall into the fall and a gain in wisdom". [^1] |

#### Give a typical example

**In the post-financial crisis period, neither neoliberalism nor Keynesianism could make economic policies reach the optimal state.**

In the post-financial crisis period, neither the development strategy of neoliberalism nor Keynesianism could make the economic policy reach the optimal state. In this view, the economic crisis is also essentially a crisis of economic theory. Neoliberalism and Keynesianism are both products of specific historical conditions and developed in order to solve specific problems in specific periods. Keynesianism, which advocates the expansion of the power of the state, is not only the darling of the state, but also a timely response to the crisis. Neoliberalism argues that economic freedom is not only the darling of the market but also the theoretical necessity for the outward expansion of capitalist countries. The 2008 US financial crisis marked the demise of neoliberalism, while the European sovereign debt crisis marked the demise of Keynesianism. In today's failure of neoliberalism and Keynesianism, it is time to introduce innovative theoretical policies to prevent, deal with and manage the crisis. However, in the face of the economic downturn and serious unemployment, the United States and other capitalist countries used Keynesian policies to deal with the crisis again. Until the crisis broke out, the capitalist economy was still in a slow development stage. Therefore, both neoliberalism and Keynesianism are not adapted to the current state, and they should seek new economic theories in the post-financial crisis period. ^[韩佳玲.后金融危机时期资本主义主流意识形态的走向研究综述[J].商,2016:207.]

## Question 2 <badge text="Zhou Kang" />

> What is the tone of the statement in paragraph 15?

Critical.

## Question 3 <badge text="Lin Jiacheng" />

> Comment on the following translations:
>
> 1. The preference for fact over logic, for deed over dogma (paragraph 16)
>    1. 看重事实而非推理，看重行动而非教条
> 2. the uncoerced intercourse of unconstrained minds:
>    1. 自由思想不受约束的交流
>    2. 自由的、不受约束的思想交流

### Translation 1

本句的“preference”采用了词性转换的翻译方法，翻译成“看重”，这是能接受的。但是，后续的两个“而非”与“preference for”的本意就有偏差了。

根据牛津词典解释：

preference: a greater interest in or desire for somebody/something than somebody/something else

由此我们能够发现，这是一个比较的行为或者情感倾向。译文中“看重...而非..”则带有否定后者的意味，语意过重，建议修改。

此外，“教条”一词也与“看重”不太搭配，需更换用词。

新译文：偏爱实证高于推理，注重行动多于理论。

### Translation 2

译文一翻译受英文原句约束，汉语表达不连贯。例如：“思想”和“交流”两个词中间不宜出现过多修饰语，否则容易意思断层。观察原文，可以发现落脚点是交流，“uncoerced”和“unconstrained”虽然修饰不同单词，但本意是表达强调。因此，译文二会更合适一些。但其译文还需再次修改，“的”字多次使用不符合中文用语习惯。

修改结果为：自由而不受约束的思想交流。

## Question 4 <badge text="Zhou Kang" />

> Why has there been much discussion on underdeveloped countries? What is the author's view on this issue?

Because underdeveloped countries face numerous political and economic problems.

It is a problem to be answered by experience and experiment.

## Question 5 <badge text="Lin Jiacheng & Jin Zhenxian" />

> TRANSLATION (paragraph 19):
>
> 1. ...so long as there is human hunger for an all-embracing, all-explanatory system...
> 2. ...so long indeed as political philosophy is shaped by the compulsion to return to the womb.

1. 只要还有人渴望找到包罗万象、知无不答的意识形态体系。
2. 只要这种追根溯源的冲动仍然主导着政治理念的形成。
