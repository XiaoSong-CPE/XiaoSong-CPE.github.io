> 把自己的喜怒哀乐，完全寄托在另外一个人身上，原是一件十分危险的事。对方喜则自己心花怒放，对方怒则自己心惊胆战，对方的一笑一颦，完全控制着自己的情绪起落，这又何苦呢？
> 面对书本，则完全没有这种麻烦。择书比择友简单得多。不擅辞令、厌恶应酬的人，可以自由自在的徜徉于书林之中，游目四顾，俯拾皆友。
> 看书，可以博览，可以细嚼，没有人会怪你喜新厌旧，也没有人要求你从一而终。你大可以从一本换到另一本，喜爱的书，不妨一读再读；不耐看的书，又可随手抛下，谁也不会因此而伤心失望。人际关系错综复杂，那“书际关系”呢？只要花点时间去了解，再高深的学问也弄得明白。
> 手持一书，吟哦于四壁之中，神游于四海之外，既可以与老庄谈心，又可以跟柏拉图对话。心情烦闷时，济慈、雪莱在你耳畔喁喁细语，巴尔扎克为你搬演“人间喜剧”，还有李白、杜甫、王尔德、莎士比亚……一大堆才华横溢的朋友等着你呼唤前来。

Depositing all of one's emotions onto another person is a dangerous thing. If the other person is happy, you'll be overjoyed; if the other person is angry, you'll be frightened. Their every expression controls your emotional ups and downs. What's the point of this?

When facing books, there are no such troubles. Choosing books is much simpler than choosing friends. For people who are not good with words or dislike socializing, they can freely wander through the forest of books, looking around and finding many friends.

Reading can be extensive or detailed, and no one will blame you for liking new things or getting tired of old ones, nor will anyone require you to stick to one book. You can switch from one book to another, read your favorite books again and again, and easily drop books that you don't feel like reading anymore without hurting anyone's feelings. Human relationships are complicated, but what about "book relationships"? With some time spent understanding them, even the most profound knowledge can be understood.

Holding a book, you can meditate within the four walls, travel beyond the seas, talk with Laozi, and have a conversation with Plato. When you're feeling upset, Keats and Shelley whisper in your ear, Balzac performs "Human Comedy" for you, and Li Bai, Du Fu, Oscar Wilde, Shakespeare... a bunch of talented friends are waiting for you to call upon them.

::: details Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji
It is very dangerous to let somebody be master of your sentiments, such as joy, anger, pleasure and sorrow. For example, you are elated simply because the other party looks cheerful, you are jumpy simply because the other party looks put out. Consequently, you are completely at the mercy of the other party as regards your own mood. Is it worth it?

As to books, things are entirely different.

It is much easier to choose a book than a friend. One who is poor at speech and shuns socializing will nevertheless feel like being surrounded by friends while sauntering freely in the midst of books.Some books are to be read cursorily, and some are to be chewed and digested. None will ever call you fickle-minded, and none will ever demand that you be constant in your affection. You can go from one book to another. And you can read your favourite book over and over again. When you lay aside the book you dislike, none will ever feel hurt or disappointed. While interpersonal relations are most complicated, what about your relations with books? Devote your time to studies, and you will be able to acquire any knowledge no matter how profound it is.

While being confined to your small room with a book in your hand, your mind will be roaming throughout the world. You will not only have a heart-to-heart chat with Laozi and Zhuangzi, but also converse with Plato. When you are in a mood, Keats and Shelley will whisper to you soothingly, and Balzac will amuse you with stories from his __La Comédie humaine__. And a galaxy of talented friends like Li Bai,Du Fu, Oscar Wilde, Shakespeare... will come to you at your call.

1. “把自己的喜怒哀乐，完全寄托在另外一个人身上”意即“让别人控制自己的喜怒哀乐情绪”，故译为 to let somebody be master of your sentiments, such as joy, anger, pleasure and sorrow.

2. “厌恶应酬”译为 shuns socializing，其中用 shuns (avoids deliberately) 替代 dislikes; socialize 的意思是“参加社交活动”，也可译为 dislikes social functions，但 social functions 指社交集会，如聚会、宴会等，涵盖不如 socialize 广。

3. “可以细嚼”本可译为 some are to be chewed carefully，现引用英国哲学家弗兰西斯·培根（Francis Bacon）《谈读书》（Of Studies）一文中的用语，把“细嚼”译为 to be chewed and digested (咀嚼消化)，无损原意。

4. “心情烦闷时”译为 When you are in a mood，其中 in a mood 是成语，作“情绪不好”、“生气”解。soothingly 是根据上下文而添加的成分，作“用抚慰的口气”解。

5. “在你耳畔喁喁细语”译为 will whisper to you soothingly。

6. “巴尔扎克为你搬演‘人间喜剧’”可按“巴尔扎克重述‘人间喜剧’中的故事,为你带来乐趣”译为 Balzac will amuse you with stories from his La Comédie humaine.
