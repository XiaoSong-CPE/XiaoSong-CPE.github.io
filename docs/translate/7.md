> 再往南行入西班牙，气候就变得干暖。马德里在高台地的中央七月的午间并不闷热，人夜甚至得穿毛衣。我在南部安达露西亚地区及阳光海岸（Costa del Sol）开车，一路又干又热，枯黄的草原，干燥的石堆，大地像一块烙饼，摊在酷蓝的天穹之下，路旁的草从常因干燥而起火，势颇惊人。可是那是干热，并不令人出汗，和台湾的湿闷不同。
> 英国则趋于另一极端，显得阴湿，气温也低。我在伦敦的河堤区住了三天，一直是阴天，下着间歇的毛毛雨。即使破晓时露一下朝嗷早餐后天色就阴沉下来了。与我存走过滑铁卢桥，7月的河风吹来水气阴阴，令人打一个寒噤，把毛的翻领拉起。我们开车北行，一路上经过塔尖如梦的牛津，城楼似幻的勒德洛（Ludlow），古桥野渡的蔡斯特（Chester），雨云始终罩在车顶，雨点在车窗上也未干过。进人步布瑞亚的湖区·之后，遍地江湖，满空云雨，偶见天边绽出一角薄蓝，立刻便有更多的灰云挟雨遮掩过来。真要怪华兹华斯的诗魂小气，不肯让我一窥他诗中的晴美湖光。在我一夕投宿的鹰头（Hawkshead）小店栈楼窗望出去，沿湖一带，树树含雨，山山带云很想告诉格拉斯米教堂墓地里的诗翁，我国古代有一片云梦大泽，也出过一位水气逼人的诗宗。

Heading further south into Spain, the climate becomes dry and warm. Madrid, located in the center of a high plateau, is not humid at noon in July, and people even need to wear sweaters at night. I drove through the southern region of Andalusia and the Costa del Sol, where it was dry and hot, with yellowed grasslands, dry stone piles, and the earth as flat as a pancake under the cool blue sky. The grass on the roadside frequently caught fire due to the dryness, which was quite alarming. However, it was a dry heat that didn't make people sweat, unlike the humid and stuffy weather in Taiwan.

In contrast, the United Kingdom tends towards the opposite extreme, appearing damp and with low temperatures. I stayed in the riverbank area of London for three days, where it was always cloudy with intermittent drizzles. Even if it cleared up briefly at dawn for breakfast, the sky would soon become overcast again. Walking across Waterloo Bridge, the river breeze in July was chilly, making me pull up my collar. We drove north, passing through dreamlike spires of Oxford, the castle-like Ludlow, and the ancient bridge of Chester. The rain clouds were always hovering over our heads, and the raindrops on the car window never dried up. After entering the Lake District of Ambleside, the ground was covered with lakes, and the sky was filled with clouds and rain. Occasionally, a small corner of light blue would appear on the horizon, but more grey clouds carrying rain would soon cover it up. I couldn't help but blame Wordsworth's poetry for being so stingy, refusing to let me glimpse the clear and beautiful lake in his verses. Looking out of the window of the small shop in Hawkshead where I stayed overnight, the trees and mountains along the lake were filled with rain, as if telling the poetic soul in the graveyard of the Grasmere church that in ancient times, our country had a dreamy and vast sea of clouds and also had a poetic tradition that was as misty as the weather.

Down in Spain, the climate is arid and warm. Madrid is located in thecenter of a plateau. Its noontime temperature in July is not sultry, and youhave to wear a woolen sweater towards the evening. In Southern Spain,when driving in the Andalucia region and along the Costa del Sol, I foundeverything dry and hot. The grass was turning yellow and the rocks weredry. The earth was like a pancake roasting under the deep blue firmament.Alarmingly, the roadside grass often started burning by itself. UnlikeTaiwan which is humid, Southern Spain is hot and dry and so people theredon't sweat at all.

England is at the other extreme, being overcast and wet with a lowtemperature. It was gloomy all the time and kept drizzling intermittentlyduring the three days when I stayed in the River Embankment area ofLondon. Sometimes the morning sun made its brief appearance at daybreak,but the sky turned overcast soon after breakfast. While crossing WaterlooBridge with Wocun against the July wind blowing from the River Thames, a nip in the air sent shivers down my spine, forcing me to turn up my furcollar. We drove up north through Oxford with its dreamy spires, Ludlowwith its illusory old castles and Chester with its ancient bridge and solitaryferry crossing. Rain clouds continued to hang over our car and raindropsremained intact on its windows. After entering the Lake District, Cumbria.we found rivers and lakes everywhere and the sky full of rain clouds.Occasionally a speck of light blue would appear over the horizon only tobe soon blotted out by dark grey rain clouds. I could not help complaining against Wordsworth for grudging me a sunny scene of the beautifulLakeland as described in his poems. In Hawkshead, I put up for one nightat a small inn. Looking out of its window, I saw all trees around the lakeswet with rain and all mountains shrouded by clouds. How I longed to tellthe great poet* lying in Grasmere Churchyard that in ancient China therewas also a great poet** domiciled in a region of rivers and lakes!
