> 艺术作品最终成为商品，这是客观规律，无可非议。但在一时盛名之下，往往不够艺术价值的劣画也都招摇过市，欺蒙喜爱的收藏者，被市场上来回倒卖，互相欺骗。我早下决心要毁掉所有不满意的作品，不愿谬种流传。开始屠杀生灵了，屠杀自己的孩子。将有遗憾的次品一批批，一次次张挂起来审查，一次次淘汰，一次次刀下留人，一次次重新定案。一次次，一批批毁，画在纸上的，无论墨彩、水彩、水粉，可撕得粉碎。作在布上的油画只能用剪刀剪，剪成片片。作在三合板上的最不好办，需用油画颜料涂盖。儿媳和小孙孙陪我整理，他们帮我展开六尺以上的巨幅一同撕裂时也满怀惋惜之情，但惋惜不得啊！我往往教儿媳替我撕，自己确乎也有不忍下手的隐痛。画室里废纸成堆了，于是儿媳和阿姨抱下楼去用火烧，我在画室窗口俯视院里熊熊之火中飞起的作品的纸灰，也看到许多围观的孩子和邻居们在交谈，不知他们说些什么。画室里尚有一批覆盖了五颜六色的三合板，只能暂时堆到阳台上去，还不知能派什么用场，记得困难时期我的次品油画是用来盖鸡窝的。

Works of art eventually become commodities, this is an objective law, beyond reproach.However, under the temporary fame, the bad paintings, which are often not enough artistic value, are also flaunted on the market, deceiving the favorite collectors, who are sold back and forth in the market and deceive each other.I had made up my mind early on to destroy all unsatisfactory works, and not to spread the fallacies.It's killing people. It's killing its own children.There will be regretful defective products in batches, again and again hanging up the review, again and again eliminated, again and again under the knife to retain people, again and again to finalize the case.Time after time, batches of destroyed, painted on paper, no matter ink color, watercolor, gouache, can be torn to pieces.Painting on cloth can only be cut with scissors, cut into pieces.Those made on plywood are the most difficult and need to be covered with oil paint.My daughter-in-law and grandchildren accompany me to finish, they help me to spread more than six feet of huge tear together also full of regret, but regret not ah!I often teach my daughter-in-law to tear it for me, and I do have a dull pain that I cannot bear to do it.There were piles of waste paper in the studio, so my daughter-in-law and aunt carried me downstairs to burn the fire. From the window of the studio, I looked down at the paper ashes of the works flying from the raging fire in the courtyard. I also saw many onlookers talking with neighbors, I did not know what they were saying.There was still a batch of multicoloured plywood in the studio, which could only be temporarily piled on the balcony. I did not know what to do with it. I remembered that my defective oil painting was used to cover the chicken nest in difficult times.

::: details Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji
I produced a great many paintings during the scores of difficult years.Some of them were my favorites, some were defective, some, though unsatisfactory, were fruits of my painstaking labor... All art explorers are liable to take roundabout courses or lead themselves astray, thus ending up in fiascoes. Defective works should be exposed rather than covered up.But things on earth have changed and men are so much under the sway of money that they have become conscienceless and unfeeling. Paintings, nowadays, have market prices. Many of my paintings given as presents to friends, schoolmates, students and newspapers and periodicals have found their way to the market or auction house. In the 1950s, after I finished a set of Jinggang Mountain landscape paintings, I donated a replica of it to the Jinggang Mountain Administrative Office at its request for permanent museum display. Later, when I looked over the original set of the paintings, which represented the immature stage of my attempts at nationalizing oil painting, I felt dissatisfied and had it all destroyed by fire. Unexpectedly, however, the replicated paintings recently showed up one after another in an auction house. Making a gift of painting or calligraphy to friends has been a traditional virtue of ours related to interpersonal relationship, which values affection above material gains.
