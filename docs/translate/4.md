> 历史的道路，不会是坦平的，有时走到艰难险阻的境界。这是全靠雄健的精神才能够冲过去的。
> 一条浩浩荡荡的长江大河，有时流到很宽阔的境界，平原无际，一泻万里。有时流到很逼狭的境界，两岸丛山迭岭，绝壁断崖，江河流于其间,回环曲折，极其险峻。民族生命的进展，其经历亦复如是。
> 人类在历史上的生活正如旅行一样。旅途上的征人所经过的地方，有时是坦荡平原，有时是崎岖险路。志于旅途的人，走到平坦的地方，因是高高兴兴地向前走，走到崎岖的境界，愈是奇趣横生，觉得在此奇绝壮绝的境界，愈能感到一种冒险的美趣。
> 中华民族现在所逢的史路，是一段崎岖险阻的道路。在这一段道路上，实在亦有一种奇绝壮绝的境致，使我们经过此段道路的人，感得一种壮美的趣味。但这种壮美的趣味，是非有雄健的精神不能够感觉到的。

The path of history is not flat. Sometimes there are cliffs that can only be crossed with great courage.

Suppose there is a long river. Here it flows through wide, even places, and there it flows through narrow, uneven places. The course of national history is the same.

Suppose there is a traveller. He passes through the even places with joy and through the uneven places with courage; the more uneven the path, the more the traveller is exited. The progress of human history is the same.

China is now experiencing the very uneven path. Here we can enjoy the interest of the difficulties only if we are brave enough.

::: details Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji
The course of history is never smooth. It is sometimes beset with difficulties and obstacles and nothing short of a heroic spirit can help surmount them.

A mighty long river sometimes flows through a broad section with plains lying boundless on either side, its waters rolling on non-stop for thousands upon thousands of miles. Sometimes it comes up against a narrow section flanked by high mountains and steep cliffs, winding through a course with many a perilous twist and turn. A nation, in the course of its development, fares likewise.

The historical course of man's life is just like a journey. A traveller on a long journey passes through now a broad, level plain, now a rugged, hazardous road. While a determined traveller cheerfully continues his journey upon reaching a safe and smooth place, he finds it still more fascinating to come to a rugged place, the enormously magnificent spectacle of which, he feels, is better able to generate in him a wonderful sensation of adventure.

The Chinese nation is now confronted with a rugged and dangerous section of its historical course. Nevertheless, there is also in this section a spectacle of enormous magnificence that inspires in us passers-by a delightful sensation of splendor. And this delightful sensation, however, can only be shared by those with a heroic spirit.
