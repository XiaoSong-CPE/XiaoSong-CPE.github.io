> 我不是有腿病吗，不但不利于行，也不利于久坐。我不知道花草们受我的照顾，感谢我不感谢；我可得感谢它们。在我工作的时候，我总是写了几十个字，就到院中去看看，浇浇这棵，搬搬那盆，然后回到屋中再写一点，然后再出去，如此循环，把脑力劳动与体力劳动结合到一起，有益身心，胜于吃药。要是赶上狂风暴雨或天气突变哪，就得全家动员，抢救花草，十分紧张。几百盆花，都要很快地抢到屋里去，使人腰酸腿疼，热汗直流。第二天，天气好转，又得把花儿都搬出去，就又一次腰酸腿疼，热汗直流。可是，这多么有意思呀！不劳动，连棵花儿也养不活，这难道不是真理么？
> 送牛奶的同志，进门就夸“好香”！这使我们全家都感到骄傲。赶到昙花开放的时候，约几位朋友来看看，更有秉烛夜游的神气——昙花总在夜里放蕊。花儿分根了，一棵分为数棵，就赠给朋友们一些：看着友人拿走自己的劳动果实，心里自然特别喜欢。

You see, my legs are ill, and I have trouble walking or sitting for long periods of time. I have to thank the flowers, although I'm not sure if they appreciate the care I give them. When I work, I always write a few lines, then go to the courtyard to water this and move that. Then I continue writing, then I go out again, and so on. In this way I have combined the physical and mental work, which is more beneficial to my health than any medicine. If a storm came suddenly, all my family members would help to protect the flowers from the heavy rain. It's exciting, exhausting and sweaty because hundreds of flowers are brought inside in a short time. The next day, if the weather is good, we will take them outside, which means another exhausted and sweaty time. Still, we find it interesting. Isn't it a truth that even a flower can't be grown without hard work?

My whole family is proud of these flowers. "They smell good," the milkman said every time he came. When the epiphyllum is in bloom, I appreciate it with a few invited friends, as if I were an ancient poet walking at night with a candle - the epiphyllum always blooms at night. When the flowers have multiplied from one to several, I send some of them to my friends. I enjoy the feeling of seeing friends holding my working fruits.

> As I have some trouble with my leg, I can't move around easily, nor can I sit too long. I don't know if the flowers under my care are grateful to me or not. However, I wish for my part to acknowledge my thanks to them. I often leave off sedentary work after writing a few dozen words and go to the courtyard to take a look at the flowers, watering them and moving about the potted ones. Then I'll return to my room to write a bit more. I'll go through the same backand-forth process again and again, thus combining mental with manual labour. This is a better way to keep me fit in mind and body than taking medicine. In case of a violent storm or a sudden change of weather, however, the whole family will have to turn out to salvage the flowers and plants. Everybody will then feel keyed up. By the time when we have managed to move the several hundred potted flowers to the rooms in a hurry, we will be dog-tired and wet with perspiration. The next day, when the weather is fine, we will have another round of being dog-tired and wet with perspiration in taking all the flowers out to the courtyard again. How interesting it is! Isn't it true that without doing manual labour, we could't even keep a single flower alive?
> It filled the whole family with pride whenever the milkman exclaims on entering our gate, "What a sweet smell!” When the night-blooming cereuses are about to be in flower, we will invite some friends to visit us in the eveningto feast their eyes on them— in an atmosphere smacking of nocturnal merrymaking under candle lights. When the cereuses have branched out, we will pick some of the flowers and give them as a present to our friends. We are of course especially happy to see them take away our fruits of labour.

1. “然后再出去，如此循环”不宜按字面直译，现以灵活的办法译为I'll go through the same back-and-forth process again and again，其中定语back-and-forth作“来来往往的”解; go through the same process作“重复同一过程”。

2. “有益身心”可有两种译法：to keep me fit in mind and body 或 to keep me mentally and physically fit。

3.  “就得全家动员”  译为the whole family will have to turn out，其中动词短语to turn out 的意思是“出动”或“出来参加”。

4.  “十分紧张”译为feel keyed up ， 其中动  词短语to key up 的意思是“使 紧张”，因此keyed up 和excited、tense 等同义。

5.  “更有秉烛夜游的神气”中的“秉烛夜游”是成语，比喻“及时行乐”，今结合上下文按“夜间秉烛作乐”的意思译为nocturnal merry-making under candle lights。又，“更有.... 的神气 ” 意即“带... 的味道”，故全句译为in an atmosphere smacking of nocturnal merry-making under candle lights。
