> 这年下半年，我到了北京，以后有十几年没有离开。同时，我一面当新闻记者，一面写小说。但是我虽依旧写小说，却慢慢地摸上一点路子。觉得写小说，专门写爱情，那也似乎太狭窄。我自己以为自这以后，我的小说，又有一点小变动，以社会各种变化情形为经，以爱情为纬。我的小说自然也应该有些变化，可是我仍旧不能完全抛弃爱情。大概有几十年工夫，不，可以说一辈子吧，总是不能离开这经纬线。如《太平花》、《夜深沉》、《水浒新传》、《八十一梦》等等。

> 我是作章回小说的，对于普及，那是没有问题的。但是我们要谈普及，是在哪里下手呢？这是我们必须要研究的。要把人民日常生活，一种自然形态，在烂熟之下摘取。这里说着人民日常生活，好像很容易摘取似的。事实上不尽然，也许是很难的。我们要细心慢慢去找日常生活最普遍的一处，然后把它在适当的时候，使鲜花开出来。这不能性急，日常生活体会得越多，就会使鲜花开得越灿烂。

Later that year, I arrived in Beijing and did not leave for more than ten years after that. Meanwhile, I was working as a journalist and writing novels at the same time. But although I was still writing novels, I was slowly getting the hang of it. It seemed too narrow to write a novel that was devoted to love. I thought that since then, my novels had changed a little bit, taking the various changes in society as the warp and love as the weft. It is natural that my novels should also change somewhat, but I still cannot abandon love completely. I have been working on it for decades, no, I can say for the rest of my life, but I can never leave this warp and weft. For example, The Peaceful Flower, Deep in the Night, New Tales of the Water Margin, Eighty-one Dreams, and so on.

I am a writer of chapter books, so I have no problem in popularising them. But where do we start when we talk about popularization? This is something we have to look into. We have to take the everyday life of the people, a natural form, and extract it under a bad name. Here we are talking about the everyday life of the people, as if it were easy to extract. In fact it is not quite so, it may be very difficult. We have to look carefully and slowly at the most common aspects of everyday life and then, at the right time, make the flowers bloom. The more we experience everyday life, the more the flowers will bloom.

In the second half of the year, I went to Beijing, where I was to stay for more than ten years, both as a newspaperman and as a novelist. While I continued to write, I gradually realized that, as a novelist, I shouldn't narrow my works to the sole theme of love. So from then on, there was a small change in my writings. I wrote about social problems as well as love. Nevertheless, I have never been able to totally break away from the topic of love. It has been my favorite theme for decades or throughout my life, as witness my Taiping Flowers, Deep Night, New Shui Hu Zhuan, 81 Dreams, etc.

As a writer of novels in _zhanghui style_, I of course advocate popularization. But we have to know how to achieve it. The way is to observe people's daily life in its natural form until the time is ripe for us to pick it like an opening flower. It is not easy though. It may be very difficult. We have to look for the most common aspect of people's life and then let it blossom forth like fresh flowers in our works at an opportune time. We need to work with patience. The more we know about people's life, the more beautiful the flowers will be.

1. “以社会各种变化情形为经,以爱情为纬”意即“社会问题和爱情并重”，现参照上下文，按“不仅写爱情，并且写社会问题”译为 I wrote aboutsocial problems as well as love。
2. “可是我仍旧不能完全抛弃爱情”译为 Nevertheless, I have never beenable to totally break away from the topic of love,其中用短语 break away 表达“抛弃”,作“摆脱”解;又“爱情”指“爱情题材”,最好译为 the topic oflove，其中 the topic of 是增添词。
