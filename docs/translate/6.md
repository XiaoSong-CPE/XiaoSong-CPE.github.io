> 毕竟，先走的是比较幸福的，留下的并不是强者，可是想到这彻心切肤的病痛，我仍是要说——为了爱的缘故，这永别的苦杯，还是留给我来喝下吧。
> 我愿意在父亲、母亲及荷西的生命圆环里，做最后离世的一个，如果我先去了，而将永远的哀伤留给世上的他们，那么是死不瞑目的，因为我的爱有多深，我的牵挂便有多长。
> 所以，我几平没有选择地做了暂时的不死鸟，我的羽毛虽然因头荷西的先去，已经完全脱落，无力再飞，可是那颗碎掉的心，仍是父母的珍宝。再痛，再伤，他们也不肯我死去，我也不忍放掉他们啊。
> 总有那么一天，在金色的彼岸，会有六只爱的手臂张开了在迎我进入永生，那时，我方肯含笑狂奔而去了。
> 这份文字本是为着另一个题目写的，可是我拒绝了只有一月寿命的假想，生的艰难，尘世的苦，死别时一刹的碎心又碎心，还是由我一个人来承担吧。

After all, those who have gone earlier are happier, while those who have gone later are not strong enough. But whenever I call back the pain of separation, I still want to say, for the sake of life, leave the painful drink of separation to me. 

I prefer to be the last to die among the life rings of Father, Mother, HX and myself. If I go first, eternal misery will fall upon them. Then I won't go in peace, how deep my love, how long my care.

So I have almost no choice but to be the Phoenix temporarily. I have lost all my feathers due to the loss of HX. I can no longer fly, but my broken heart is still a treasure of my parents. No matter how painful and hurtful, they don't want me dead and I don't want them sad.

Sooner or later, in the golden hereafter, there will be six arms of love open to welcome me into eternal life. At that time I will run to them with a smile on my face.

This article was written for a different topic, but I refuse to imagine that I have only a month to live. The hardships of life, the sufferings of the world, and the heartache of parting will be borne by me alone.

Father, Mother, HX, my relatives, I love you more than my own life, so I will protect your happiness. I won't leave!

::: details Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji
Yes, those who leave first are happier than those left behind, and the latter are not necessarily the stronger. In spite of my painful illness, I reiterate that for the sake of love, let me stay behind to drink down the last bitter cup of parting.

I hope to remain with my parents and Hexi in their lifetime and be the last to pass away. It would make me turn in my grave if I should be the first to die, thus leaving them with perpetual sorrow. My concern for them is as deep as my love for them.

Therefore, I have no choice but to be a temporary surviving bird. Though I can't fly any more, having lost all my feathers due to Hexi's death, my broken heart is still treasured by my parents. They just won't let me die despite my spiritual agony and wound. And nor can I bear to lose them.

The day will surely come when six loving open arms on the other golden bank will welcome me to eternity. Then, and only then will I rush forward with a smile.

I originally intended this article to be written under another title. But I rejected the hypothesis that I was going to die in 30 days. The trials and tribulations of living, the sufferings of mortal life, the acute sorrow of parting for good — let me bear all that alone.

Dad, Mom and Hexi, my dear ones, I love you more than I do myself. So let me guard your happiness and never unthinkingly speak of my death.

1. “如果我先去了……那么是死不瞑目的” It would make me turn in my grave if I should be the first to die， 其中 make me turn in my grave 是英语成语，作“使我不能瞑目于地下”、“九泉有知当亦不安”等解。句中“那么是死不瞑目的”也可译为 I wouldn't be able to rest in peace in my grave。
2. “轻言" unthinkingly speak of..., 意同 speak of... without careful consideration。
