> 我一向没有对于任何问题作高深研究的野心，因之所买的书范围较广，宗教、艺术、文学、社会、哲学、历史、生物，各方面差不多都有一点。最多的是各国文学名著的译本，与本国古来的诗文集，别的门类只是些概论等类的入门书而已。
> 我不喜欢向别人或图书馆借书。借来的书，在我好像过不来瘾似的，必要是自己买的才满足。这也可谓是一种占有的欲望。买到了几册新书，一册一册地加盖藏书印记，我最感到快悦的是这时候。
> 书籍到了我的手里，我的习惯是先看序文，次看目录。页数不多的往往立刻通读，篇幅大的，只把正文任择一二章节略加翻阅，就插在书架上。除小说外，我少有全体读完的大部的书，只凭了购人当时的记忆，知道某册书是何种性质，其中大概有些什么可取的材料而已。什么书在什么时候再去读再去翻，连我自己也无把握，完全要看一个时期一个时期的兴趣。关于这事，我常自比为古时的皇帝，而把插在架上的书譬诸列屋而居的宫女。

I had no ambition to dive deeply into any study, so the books I bought range almost everything including religion, art, literature, sociaty, philosophy, history, biology etc. Most of them are for beginners like *An Introduction of XXX* except translated famous foreign literature and old Chinese ones.

I prefer not to borrow books from libraries or other people. Borrowed books make me lack of satisfaction, which is probably due to my desire to control. The happiest time for me is when I add new books I have just bought to my book list.

Once the books were mine, I would read the preface first, and then the contents, as was my custom. For those with little content, I read them straight through. Rarely can I read a large book in its entirety, with the exception of novels, of which I only know roughly the main theme and the material that might be useful. Even I am not sure when these books will be taken off the shelf again; it depends only on my current interest. As far as this is concerned, I often imagine that I am an ancient emperor and these books are my concubines.
