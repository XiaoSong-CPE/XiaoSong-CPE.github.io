> 我一向没有对于任何问题作高深研究的野心，因之所买的书范围较广，宗教、艺术、文学、社会、哲学、历史、生物，各方面差不多都有一点。最多的是各国文学名著的译本，与本国古来的诗文集，别的门类只是些概论等类的入门书而已。

> 我不喜欢向别人或图书馆借书。借来的书，在我好像过不来瘾似的，必要是自己买的才满足。这也可谓是一种占有的欲望。买到了几册新书，一册一册地加盖藏书印记，我最感到快悦的是这时候。

> 书籍到了我的手里，我的习惯是先看序文，次看目录。页数不多的往往立刻通读，篇幅大的，只把正文任择一二章节略加翻阅，就插在书架上。除小说外，我少有全体读完的大部的书，只凭了购人当时的记忆，知道某册书是何种性质，其中大概有些什么可取的材料而已。什么书在什么时候再去读再去翻，连我自己也无把握，完全要看一个时期一个时期的兴趣。关于这事，我常自比为古时的皇帝，而把插在架上的书譬诸列屋而居的宫女。

I had no ambition to dive deeply into any study, so the books I bought range almost everything including religion, art, literature, sociaty, philosophy, history, biology etc. Most of them are for beginners like *An Introduction of XXX* except translated famous foreign literature and old Chinese ones.

I prefer not to borrow books from libraries or other people. Borrowed books make me lack of satisfaction, which is probably due to my desire to control. The happiest time for me is when I add new books I have just bought to my book list.

Once the books were mine, I would read the preface first, and then the contents, as was my custom. For those with little content, I read them straight through. Rarely can I read a large book in its entirety, with the exception of novels, of which I only know roughly the main theme and the material that might be useful. Even I am not sure when these books will be taken off the shelf again; it depends only on my current interest. As far as this is concerned, I often imagine that I am an ancient emperor and these books are my concubines.

::: details Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji
Since I have never entertained ambition for making a profound study of any subject, the books I have acquired cover almost everything - religion , art, literature, sociology, philosophy, history , biology, etc. Most of them are Chinese translations of literary works by famous foreign writers and anthologies of Chinese poetry and prose through the ages. The rest, often called an outline or introduction, are merely on rudiments of various subjects.

I never care to borrow books from other people or a library. It seems that books bought can better satisfy my bibliomania than books borrowed. You may also attribute this to some sort of desire for personal possessions. Whenever I have some new acquisitions, it always gives me great pleasure and satisfaction to stamp my ex-libris on them one-by-one.

As soon as a new book comes to hand, I always read the preface first and then the table of contents. If it happens to be a thin one, I often finish it at one sitting. Otherwise, I often browse through one or two chapters or sections before putting it onto my bookshelf. I seldom read a thick book from cover to cover unless it is a novel. By dint of the first impression it made on me at the time of buying, I have a rough idea of what a book is about and what useful materials init are available to me. But I have little idea which book is to be read or looked over again at what time. It is completely subject to the whims of the moment. This often prompts me to liken myself and the books on my shelf respectively to an ancient emperor and his concubines housed separately in a row of adjoining rooms.

1. “since”开头，表明微弱的因果关系。
2. “entertain”一词通常用来表示“使快乐，招待款待”，但在此处表示“怀有某种想法，希望，看法(常与idea, hope, thought连用)”。此处作者采用了不寻常的表达方式。我们通常可以使用“harbor，cherish，owe”等词。
3. 研究一般都用study。例如，“研究某个事物或课题=make study of sth”，“做高深研究”可以表达为make a profound study of…。
4. 此处重点介绍cover的用法。除了大众意思外，在翻译中常见的比较小众的意思有“包括，涉及(本文采用的就是这个意思)”、“占地，范围为”、“足够，足以支付”。此外还有一个常见词coverage，它是名词，并且也可以作为“新闻报道”讲。最常见的意思是“覆盖范围”，例如我们常说的“覆盖率”就是coverage rate。
5. 文学名著可以表达为“literary works/masterpiece”。其中literary表示文学的或精通文学的；而literacy则强调读写能力。前者是形容词而后者是名词，请注意不要混淆。
6. Through the ages意为历来或古往今来。例如：Through the ages, the structural skill and artistic style of Zhaozhou Brige are widely used as a reference point.(千百年来，赵州桥的结构技巧、艺术风格被广泛地借鉴运用)
7. care to 可以表示喜欢。除了like之外，be fond of也是一个不错的选择。
8. “过不来瘾”可以理解为不能满足我的藏书癖。此句翻译时将两句融合成一个比较句子，简洁流畅，并且值得学习。
9. 可谓是…可使用attribute to(归因于)进行表达。此处转换了主语，在翻译中也很常见。
10. 买到了几册新书并加盖藏书印记时我感到最快悦。在遇到动词较多时，请首先找出主要动词，并将不主要动词降级成从句、非谓语或介词短语等形式进行表达。
11. at one sitting=at a sitting可表示一口气。
12. browse through=go through可表示浏览。
13. have little idea 表示对某事知之甚少。
14. Look over 表示过目。
15. Subject to 意为“受制于…，以…为条件，以…为准”。
16. Whims意为“忽起的念头，奇想”，常用于词组at the whim of sb(由着某人性子)。
17. Prompt “激起，促使，导致”，又是一个可以替换make 的高级词汇
18. “把…比作”用liken sth to sth。
19. “列屋而居”= housed separately in a row of adjoining rooms.此处将house 用作动词的方法也可以借鉴。
