> 坐在窗前的写字台前伏案工作，会忽然听见“咕，咕，咕”的悦耳声音，抬头一望，原来是两只白色的鸽子站在窗外的窗沿上，正在亲昵地对话。我不愿惊扰它们，便静静地坐在那里，欣赏它们的漂亮形体与温柔姿态。待它们亲执地谈得够了，就会转过小巧的头颅，用它们那双明亮的小眼睛，与我对视。每逢这时，我就很想告诉它们，我是多么地喜欢鸽子，毕加索笔下的那只名鸽，其实远不如真实的鸽子美丽。我还会产生错觉，不知是这对鸽子还是自己，正住在“鸟巢”里，也不知我与它们是否同类。它们的小脑袋里想些什么，我一无所知，反正是等到它们流连得够了，就展翅飞翔，飞回到属于它们自己的巢里，那个鸟巢比我的“鸟巢”平方米略少，不过也是悬在半空，悬在对面那座塔楼的一家住户的阳台上。

When I sit at my desk in front of the window and work, I will suddenly hear the sweet voice "Goo, goo, goo". When I look up, it turns out that there are two white pigeons standing on the windowsill outside the window, having a intimate conversation. Not wishing to disturb them, I sat quietly admiring their beautiful form and tender gestures. When they had had enough of their affectionate talk, they would turn their little heads and look at me with their bright little eyes. At such times, I would like to tell them how much I love pigeons. The famous pigeon painted by Picasso is not nearly as beautiful as the real one. I have the illusion that it is the pair of pigeons or I who live in the nest, and whether I am of their kind or not. I do not know what goes on in their little heads, but when they have had enough, they spread their wings and fly back to their own nest, a little less square than mine, but also suspended in midair over the balcony of one of the occupants of the opposite tower.

Sometimes, sitting at my desk before the window, I will suddenly hear a soft cooing sound and, looking up, I find a pair of white doves billing and cooing on the outer windowsill. Unwilling to alarm them, I will sit quietly admiring their elegant shape and gentle carriage. At the end of their rendezvous, they will turn their heads and exchange stares with me, their tiny eyes glistening. I will, on such occasions, be very eager to let them know how I love doves and that the famous dove painted by Picasso is far less beautiful than real doves. I will feel confused as to who should be the real dweller of the "nest" — the pair of doves or me, and whether we are of the same kind. I don't know what thoughts they have in their tiny brains. Anyway, after enjoying themselves to their heart's content, they will fly back to the nest of their own. It is somewhat smaller than mine by several square meters, but is also hanging in midair, over the balcony of a residence in the opposite tower building.

1. “正在亲昵地对话”未按字面直译为talking together softly(或affectionately)，而采用成语 billing and cooing(谈情说爱)，取其简洁利落。
2. “待它们亲热地谈得够了”译为At the end of their rendezvous(或tryst),取其简洁。未译为After they had finished talking together softly或Afterthey had finished demonstrating their affection等。
