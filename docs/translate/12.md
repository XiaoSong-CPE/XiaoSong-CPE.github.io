> 过去几年的、在东京的苦闷不眠的夜晚——相伴我的只有瓦檐上的雨声，纸窗外的月色，更多的是空虚——沉重的、黑黝黝的长夜；而每一个不眠的夜晚，我都听到嘎达嘎达的木屐声音，一阵一阵的从我楼前走过。这声音，踏在石子路上，清空而又坚实；它不像我从前听过的、引人憎恨的、北京东单操场上日本军官的军靴声，也不像北京饭店的大厅上日本官员、绅士的皮鞋声。这是日本劳动人民的，风里雨里寸步不离的，清空而又坚实的木屐的声音……

> 我把双手交叉起，枕在脑后，随着一阵一阵的屐声，在想象中从穿着木屐的双脚，慢慢地向上看，我看到悲哀憔悴的穿着外褂、套着白罩衣的老人、老妇的脸；我看到痛苦愤怒的穿着工裤、披着蓑衣的工人、农民的脸；我看到忧郁彷徨的戴着四角帽、穿着短裙的青年少女的脸……这些脸，都是我白天在街头巷尾不断看到的，这时都汇合了起来，从我楼前嘎达嘎达地走过。

> “苦难中的朋友！在这黑黝黝的长夜，希望在哪里？你们这样嘎达嘎达地往哪里走呢？”在失眠的辗转反侧之中，我总是这样痛苦地想。

The dreary, sleepless nights of the past few years in Tokyo, accompanied only by the sound of rain on the roof roof, the moonlight outside the paper window, and more emptiness — the long, heavy, dark nights;And every sleepless night I hear the clattering of clogs passing in front of my building.The sound, on the stony road, clear and firm;It was not like the resented sound of Japanese officers' boots on the Dongdan playground in Beijing, nor was it like the sound of Japanese officials and gentlemen's shoes in the lobby of Beijing Hotel.This is the sound of the Japanese working people, always in the wind and rain, empty and firm wooden clogs...

I folded my hands and put them behind my head. With the sound of clogging, I slowly looked up in my imagination from my clogging feet and saw the sad and haggard faces of old men and women in their coats and white frocks;I saw the bitter and angry faces of workers and farmers in working pants and coir coat.I see the sad, uncertain faces of young women in four-cornered hats and short skirts...These faces, which I had seen constantly in the streets during the day, converged and rattled past my building.

"Friends in distress!Where is hope in this dark night?Where are you going, rattling like this?"In my sleepless restlessness, I always thought so painfully.

::: details Übersetzt von Zhang Peiji
For several years previously, on those dull, black long nights, as I lay awake with a gloomy feeling of emptiness, the only thing that would keep me company had been the raindrops pattering on the tiled roof and the moonlight outside the paper windows. I would hear on every sleepless night wooden clogs clattering past the cobbled road before my building,sounding clear and firm. It was unlike the hateful thudding of Japanese officers' military boots I had once heard on the Dongdan drill ground in Peking. It was also unlike the clip-clop of leather shoes on the feet of Japanese officials and VIPs in the lobby of Peking Hotel. It was the clear and firm sound of wooden clogs worn by the working people of Japan, rain or shine.

Resting my head on my clasped hands, I visualized, in the midst of the clatters, all those in wooden clogs: sad and haggard elderly men and women wearing short garments under white overalls; aggrieved workers in overalls and peasants in straw rain capes; young men in college caps and young women in short skirts, all looking dejected and perplexed...I had often come across them here and there in town in the daytime. Now they seemed to merge together clattering past my building.

"My friends in distress! Where is your hope in this dark long night? Where are you bound for in your clattering clogs?" That was the thought in my gloomy mind as I lay wide awake, tossing and turning restlessly.
