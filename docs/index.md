**Ms. Na NING:** Inquired about comments on clause 5.3.1.

**Japanese expert:** Proposed deleting the description of specific observation frequency in the table, as it varies among countries and projects.

**Chinese expert:** Asked about the experience of European countries regarding observation frequency. Mentioned the strong relationship between frequency and observation results in China. Argued that deleting the frequency entirely would result in the loss of important information. Suggested finding alternative ways to describe the frequency.

**Mr. Alex Baldwin:** Stated that the matter is not within his area of expertise.

**Mr. Fern James:** Emphasized that the observation frequency depends on the type of track and building structure. Explained that their existing network is measured twice a year, with automatic areas being measured more frequently. Stressed the importance of case-specific solutions.

**Mr. Alex Baldwin:** Supported Mr. Fern James' statement, mentioning that the United Kingdom follows a similar approach with case-specific instructions for existing infrastructure and varying observation frequency for new infrastructure.

**Chinese expert:** Summarized the need to consider different track types and construction stages when determining observation frequency.

**Mr. Alex Baldwin:** Mentioned the influence of variables such as season and weather on observation frequency.

**Dr. Kiwamu TSUNO:** Stated the need to open a consensus and described the importance of dynamic observation frequency based on engineering judgment.

**Japanese expert:** Proposed not determining a specific value for observation frequency due to variations in situations and countries.

**Chinese expert:** Explained that observation frequency is based on their experience and individual testing. Emphasized the need to keep the final prediction result accurate and reasonable.

**Mr. Alex Baldwin:** Mentioned the influence of various factors on observation frequency, such as soil types and seasonal variations.

**Mr. Fern James:** Stressed the importance of case-specific solutions based on the type of track and building structure. Highlighted the need for different observation frequencies for different stages of construction.

**Japanese expert:** Mentioned the difficulty of determining observation frequency in Japan due to site-specific situations.

**Ms. Na NING:** Proposed providing general information instead of specific values in the table. Proposed discounting the specific observation frequency and asking for agreement on a general approach.

**Japanese expert:** Agreed with the proposed change and expressed satisfaction with the outcome.

**Ms. Na NING:** Inquired about comments on clause 5.3.3.

**European expert:** Asked for clarification on the concept of _winter break_. Mentioned the continuous operation of trains in certain regions.

**Ms. Na NING:** Explained that winter break refers to the suspension of construction during the winter season due to the extreme cold.

**European expert:** Stated that the presence of trains operating year-round in certain mountainous regions necessitates ongoing track measurements.

**Ms. Na NING:** Suggested deleting the first condition (winter break) from the draft, agreeing with the European expert's perspective.

**European expert:** Agreed with the deletion of the first condition, emphasizing the importance of considering the nature of the construction and the type of materials used in determining observation frequency.

**Ms. Na NING:** Discussed clause 5.3.5 regarding horizontal displacement. Proposed merging it with clause 5.3.2 and deleting it, suggesting that the frequency should be determined based on construction stage, railway line class, and prediction accuracy.

**Mr. Alex Baldwin:** Expressed satisfaction with the proposed modification.

**Mr. Panu Tolla:** Stated that the formulation was good but emphasized the need for more specific technical requirements, including measuring frequency, identification of local problems, and sharing of shape and development. Suggested using an annex to provide examples from different countries, including China, Japan, and Europe, to serve as references.

**Ms. Na NING:** Acknowledged the need for minimum requirements but emphasized that the document is a technical specification rather than an international standard. Agreed with Mr. Panu Tolla's suggestion to provide examples in an annex.

**Japanese expert:** Recommended including examples from different countries in the informative annex to provide references for users. Emphasized the importance of clarity and understanding the functional aspects of monitoring, especially for new lines.

**Ms. Na NING:** Agreed with the idea of including examples in the annex and suggested preparing them for discussion in the next meeting, incorporating inputs from China, Europe, and Japan.

**Japanese expert:** Proposed not solely including Chinese standards in the informative annex but rather presenting it as an example from a specific country, including details on measurement equipment, design, and measurement conditions.

**Ms. Na NING:** Acknowledged the suggestion and agreed to work on proposing examples for the annex, taking into account the discussion points.

**Japanese expert:** Highlighted the need to further address the issue of train speed specification in the technical specification, suggesting that it should not be explicitly specified.

**Chinese expert:** Accepted the proposed modification regarding train speed specification.

**Ms. Na Ning:** Mentioned comments of clause 6.3.1. Proposed keeping the first paragraph and deleting the example in clause 6.3.1. Suggested creating a new table to address the missing information.

**Japanese expert:** Apologised for their confusion about the comments on clause 6.3.1 which had already been discussed at the last meeting. Agreed with keeping the first paragraph and deleting the example.

**Ms. Na NING:** Mentioned the need to address clause 6.3.2 and suggested moving the table and explanation to the annex.

**Chinese expert:** Accepted the proposal to move the table to the annex and asked for clarification on whether to keep clause 6.3.2.

**Japanese expert:** Suggested discussing the matter after creating a new informative annex and emphasized the need for input from Japan and European countries regarding the threshold values.

**Chinese expert:** Agreed with the suggestion and acknowledged the need for additional input from Japan and European countries.

**Ms. Na NING:** Concluded that all comments had been addressed.
