## Fragen

__5. 第46页PPT，第6段翻译是否准确？__

> Original sentence: United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do — for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.

> Translation from PPT: 如果我们团结一致，我们在一系列共同从事的事业中就可以无往而不胜。如果我们四分五裂，我们就会一事无成——因为在意见分歧、四分五裂的情况下，我们不敢迎接强有力的挑战。

The translation of the sentence in paragraph 6 from PPT is basically accurate. It conveys the original meaning, indicates the underlying logical relationship and retains the sentence structure.

However, translations can always be improved. Firstly, "我们" occurs five times, which is a duplicate expression in Chinese. Second, as a typical parataxis language, Chinese does not necessarily require specific logical connections. Thirdly, the original sentence is formal and poetic, but the translation is relatively casual ("如果……就", "不敢").

A possible better translation is "团结一心，我们将在共同事业中创造无限可能；分裂割据，我们将一筹莫展——因为我们无法在分歧和纷争中应对强劲挑战。"
