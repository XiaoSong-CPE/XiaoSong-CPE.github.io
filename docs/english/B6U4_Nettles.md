## Fragen

### Fragen von Ms Hee

1. __Why did the author choose "nettles" as the title of the story? What does it mean?__
   - In the story, "I" thought nettles were "pinkish-purple clusters", but they are actually "insignificant plants, with stalks wickedly outfitted with fine, fierce, skin-piercing and inflaming spines". In other words, nettles are something that give people a dreamy fantasy, but are actually not so good or e ven harmful. Stinging nettles represent the relationship between "I" and Mike, which is also dreamlike but harmful if it goes too deep.
2. __What is the narrative structure of the story? How does the author start the story? Do you find this beginning interesting or strange? Why or why not?__
   - The narrative structure of the story is basically chronological with some flashbacks.
   - The author begins her story in a rather unusual way. She starts her narration from 1979 in the brief beginning paragraph.
   - This allows her to infuse her stories with a sort of floating suspense, inducing the readers to continue.
3. __How is the time shifted in para. 16?__
   - By using scene or chapter breaks.
   - By specifying the year (“1979”).
   - By indicating past perfect tense (“had met”).
4. __In para. 29, why did the author say "I would have told her lies, anyway, or half lies."" ?__
5. __Translation of the sentence in para. 72: "Goldenrod, jewelweed with its red-and-yellow bells, and what I thought were flowering nettles with pinkish-purple clusters, and wild asters."__
   - 有金菊花，有形如红黄色铃铛的凤仙花，有我当时以为是荨麻盛开的粉紫色花团，还有紫菀花。

### Exercises

Why did she and Mike wash the dog, Ranger, in tomato juice? 
: Because Ranger chased a skunk, and the skunk turned and sprayed him. Mike did so, so as to clean her up.

They played a game of war with other boys and girls. Retell this part of the story in your own words. How important is this memory to the narrator?
