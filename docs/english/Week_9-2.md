## Question 1 (GPT-4)

> Translation：So let us begin anew — remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.

让我们重新开始——双方都要牢记，文明礼让并非软弱的表现，真诚始终需要经得起检验。让我们永远不要因恐惧而谈判，但也永远不要害怕进行谈判。
