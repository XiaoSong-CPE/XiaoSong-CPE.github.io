## Edna's Struggle: A Tale of Hopelessness

In the novel _The Awakening_, characters face various challenges and possess humanistic values that affirm their uniqueness and their heroic fight for survival. Sadly, their destinies remain unchangeable, regardless of their relentless efforts. This is exemplified in _The Awakening_, where Edna embarks on a journey to discover her true self, only to be met with failure. Her tragic demise signifies the conflict between her longing for personal fulfillment and the constraints imposed by society.

Throughout the story, Edna grapples with her role as a mere object in Victorian society. Yet, for a woman to seek individuality means relinquishing traditional femininity, losing the familiar reflection of womanhood. Searching for a self-image in the mirror becomes an enchantment fraught with danger.

Edna's futile struggle begins in her childhood when she rebels against prayers and her father's solemn Presbyterian services. Her marriage to Mr. Pontellier can also be seen as a rebellion against her father's tyranny. She yearns to break free from her father's control and believes she will find happiness with her husband. However, her expectations are shattered as she falls into her husband's trap. For six years, Edna dutifully fulfills her societal roles as a mother and wife. But when she awakens to her true identity, she decides to challenge her husband's authority. She refuses to entertain guests on their regular reception day, causing her husband to reproach her and eventually abandon her. Frustrated, she symbolically removes her wedding ring and attempts to crush it under her heel, only to find it remains intact. This incident illustrates the futility of Edna's struggle against societal norms.

Edna also strives for economic independence through her pursuit of art. Painting grants her a taste of success, particularly when her father visits her in New Orleans. As she sketches the colonel's portrait, he becomes motionless under her influence, acting as an object for her artistic expression. In this dynamic, Edna assumes the role of a subject—a budding artist—while the colonel serves as her muse. Through art, she challenges social constraints and advocates for her own artistic fulfillment.

However, Edna's triumph is short-lived. She lacks the discipline required to develop her artistic talents or endure the necessary ostracism that comes with individualism. The path of an artist demands immense dedication, as emphasized by Mademoiselle Reisz. The pianist recognizes Edna's lack of discipline and her failure to comprehend the true essence of being an artist. According to her, a female artist must rise above tradition and prejudice. When Mademoiselle Reisz touches Edna's back, metaphorically searching for her "wings," she discovers their absence. Edna cannot be a female artist because she cannot exist without love, sexuality, and connection.

As Edna's self-awareness grows, she leaves the grand house in New Orleans and settles in her own "pigeon house." Her children visit their grandmother, and her husband is occupied with business. Initially, Edna believes she has achieved autonomy—a free and single woman unburdened by the roles of wife and mother. However, this newfound freedom is illusory; her family's absence is only temporary, not permanent. Chopin aptly names her new residence a "pigeon house," signifying that it is just another type of cage. Unlike the drab street pigeons, these domesticated birds were elegantly colored but still captive. Edna has merely traded one gilded cage for a simpler one. Pigeons may fly away momentarily, but they always return.

During her quest for self-discovery, Edna falls in love with Robert, believing him to be her soulmate. However, at the end of the novel, she realizes that Robert, despite claiming to love her, views her as an object, conforming to societal expectations. In their final encounter at the "pigeon house," Robert tells her that he must bid farewell because he loves her and cannot have her unless Leonce sets her free. Edna comprehends that Robert embraces tradition and fails to truly understand her. He does not recognize that she belongs to herself. In response, she declares that she is no longer Leonce's possession to be disposed of as he pleases. She rejects both Robert and her husband, showcasing her resilience and autonomy. Ultimately, realizing the futility of her struggle for self-identity, Edna chooses to end her life. She becomes a victim of a callous and indifferent world.

In the novel _The Awakening_, Edna embarks on a quest for self-discovery, hoping to break free from societal constraints. However, her efforts prove futile, leading to a tragic end. Edna rebels against her predetermined role as a woman in Victorian society but finds herself trapped in a cycle of unfulfilled desires.

From an early age, Edna resists the oppressive influence of her father's religious practices. Her marriage to Mr. Pontellier seems like an escape, but it only leads to further disappointment. As a devoted wife and mother, she conforms to societal norms, yet a growing awareness of her true identity pushes her to challenge her husband's expectations.

Edna's pursuit of economic independence through art grants her fleeting success. She sees herself as an artist and attempts to shape her world through her creations. However, she lacks the discipline required to fully develop her talents and withstand the criticism that comes with artistic individuality.

Edna's search for love leads her to Robert, whom she believes to be her soulmate. However, their relationship ultimately proves unfulfilling, as Robert too views her as an object rather than an independent individual. In the end, Edna realizes the futility of her struggle for selfhood and chooses to end her life.

Edna's story serves as a tragic reminder of the limitations imposed by society. Despite her attempts to break free and find fulfillment, she becomes a victim of an indifferent world, unable to reconcile her desires with the constraints of her time.

In Kate Chopin's novel, "The Awakening," the central theme revolves around the societal challenges faced by women in the 19th century and their struggle for self-identity and personal freedom. The protagonist, Edna Pontellier, represents a rebellious spirit who defies social norms and dares to express her desires and aspirations as a woman. Through Edna's journey, Chopin explores the themes of female autonomy, societal constraints, and the consequences of pursuing individuality in a restrictive environment.

Edna Pontellier emerges as a symbol of defiance against traditional gender roles and expectations.

Edna's awakening leads her to question her own desires and needs, seeking personal fulfillment and emotional satisfaction beyond the confines of societal expectations.

One of the central themes in "The Awakening" is the exploration of female self-identity. Edna's pursuit of self-awareness and personal freedom highlights the struggle faced by women to define themselves outside of predefined roles. As she becomes increasingly aware of her own desires, Edna rebels against the societal norms that confine and restrict her. Her quest for self-discovery and individuality becomes a catalyst for change, challenging the status quo and the established order.

Another prominent theme in the novel is the tension between personal desires and societal obligations. Edna's awakening to her own desires creates a conflict between her individual needs and the expectations placed upon her by society. The societal pressures to conform and the stifling expectations of marriage and motherhood become significant obstacles in Edna's pursuit of personal fulfillment.

Through Edna's journey, Chopin also explores the consequences of seeking liberation in a patriarchal society. Despite Edna's efforts to assert her independence and pursue her desires, she faces numerous challenges and setbacks. The societal backlash and isolation she experiences serve as a reminder of the limitations placed upon women at that time. The tragic ending of the novel further emphasizes the difficulties and dangers of defying societal norms.

## Lost in the Shadows: Léonce Pontellier's Journey in The Awakening

In Kate Chopin's novel _The Awakening_, Léonce Pontellier is portrayed as a character who embodies conservatism, materialism, and a lack of imagination. As Edna's husband, Léonce is more concerned with business and maintaining appearances than understanding the emotional journey his wife undergoes throughout the novel.

Léonce's conventional views on gender relations restrict his ability to comprehend Edna's desires and dissatisfaction. He fails to recognize her infatuation with Robert Lebrun or her growing discontentment with their marriage. Even when Edna takes the significant step of renting her own house and leaving Léonce's mansion, he remains oblivious to her departure from their shared life.

The intense focus Léonce places on his business blinds him to Edna's process of self-realization and personal growth. Instead of seeing her as an individual with her own dreams and aspirations, he treats her more like a possession or an employee. This skewed perspective shapes his reactions to Edna's actions, as he primarily considers how they will impact his financial prospects. Léonce's goals are shallow and driven by a desire to conform to the upper-class lifestyle, rather than fostering genuine emotional connection with his wife.

Léonce's materialistic nature leads him to believe that he can compensate for his lack of kindness and sensitivity towards Edna by showering her with extravagant gifts. While he does follow Dr. Mandelet's advice to allow Edna freedom in pursuing her desires, her behavior disturbs him greatly. Despite his efforts, Léonce is unable to match Edna's increasing individualism and independent spirit. He envisions an ideal wife as someone who embodies the role of a mother-woman, similar to Madame Ratignolle. However, Edna can no longer conform to this traditional notion of womanhood.

In conclusion, Léonce Pontellier's character in _The Awakening_ represents conservatism, materialism, and a failure to understand the emotional journey of his wife. His obsession with business and appearances blinds him to Edna's growth and self-realization. Léonce views his wife more as a possession or employee, treating her accordingly. His goals are centered around financial gain and maintaining a superficial upper-class lifestyle. Léonce's inability to grasp Edna's individuality and increasing dissatisfaction ultimately contributes to the disintegration of their marriage.

## The Yearning Within: A Fairy Tale of Misguided Freedom

I don't like the novel _The Awakening_ because the author's portrayal of Edna's pursuit of freedom resembles selfishness rather than a genuine desire for independence. The novel tells the story of Edna, a woman in her thirties and a mother of two, who fails to fulfill her responsibilities and sacrifices as a core member of her family.

Edna's attitude towards her husband is inconsistent and driven solely by her emotions and the opinions of others. While she claims to have a growing affection for her husband, she also acknowledges that she lacks any passion for him. She even sees him as a possession that can be easily discarded. The only thing she does for him is to show concern before his business trips, while at the same time feeling that he owns her both physically and mentally.

Similarly, Edna's attitude towards her children mirrors her behavior towards her husband. She claims to love them, but her affection is unstable and impulsive. She neglects them during the day, leaving them in the care of a nanny, and even when the children are sick at night, she remains oblivious. She sees them as opponents who weigh her down, while her friend, Madame Ratignolle, continuously devotes herself to her children.

Comparing Edna's behavior to that of her husband, it becomes clear that he genuinely cares for her well-being and respects her freedom. He never interferes with her relationships with other men, even when she stays with them. He provides for her financially and shows concern for her health and comfort. He even seeks medical help for her when she becomes mentally unstable due to her obsession with one of her romantic interests. He supports her artistic endeavors and treats her with love and kindness.

Edna's lack of responsibility towards her family can be attributed to her obsession with an idealized notion of romantic love. She believes in the concept of love outside of the confines of marriage and romanticizes the idea of a separation of love and physical desire. Her infatuation with various men, from her first love to her marriage and subsequent relationships, is driven by this romantic ideal, overshadowing her obligations as a wife and mother. Her actions reflect a selfish desire for personal fulfillment rather than genuine freedom.

In conclusion, the novel _The Awakening_ fails to depict a genuine pursuit of freedom by its protagonist, Edna. The author's portrayal of her character's actions indicates a selfish and unrealistic longing for romantic love rather than a true desire for independence. This skewed portrayal of freedom makes it difficult for me to appreciate and connect with the novel.
